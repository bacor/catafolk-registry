Catafolk notes
--------------

- Densmore reports the songs were collected in "San Xavier, Sells, and Vomari, on the Papago Reservation in Arizona". Which song was recorded were was inferred by looking at the singers and where they were living. Sells is easily located and for 'San Xiavier', the coordinates of the San Xavier Mission were used. Vomari was impossible to locate (using web search). Densmore notes it lies in the "extreme southern part" of the reservation, and (elsewhere), "about 7 miles from the Mexican border". After searching extensively, there turned out to be a village called *Vamori*, that lies between Sells and the Mexican border, so fits Densmore's description. (In [a historical map of 1943](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/img4/ht_icons/overlay/AZ/AZ_Vamori_315153_1943_62500_geo.jpg) it was also called *Vamori* rather than *Vomari*). Although it sounds unlikely that Densmore mistyped the name of the village, for lack of a better alternative, it is nevertheless assumed that *Vamori* was meant.
Finally, there is one song recorded at Pisinamak, which is "northwest of Sells". This village could also not be identified, but the there is a village "Pisinemo" which indeed lies north-west of Sells. This was used.
