  description: "Morning Star Ceremony\nA sacred bundle of the Skidi Pawnee was associated\
    \ with Morning Star\nand its ceremony was held in the early spring, having for\
    \ its object the\nsecuring of good crops in the coming season.  It was the writer's\n\
    privilege to see the Morning Star bundle in the house of the woman who\nwas its\
    \ keeper, and also to see its contents exposed in the ceremony.\nThe bundle, in\
    \ accordance with custom, was hung on the west wall of its\nowner's house, and\
    \ with it were hung four large gourds, symbolizing the\nfour deities who were\
    \ the special guardians of Evening Star and also\nrepresenting the breasts of\
    \ the two women in the west, Evening Star and\nMoon.\nThe legend from which the\
    \ Morning Star ceremony arose was related by\nComing Sun, whose grandfather was\
    \ a high priest in the Morning Star village\nand who received his name by inheritance\
    \ from this ancestor.  With Coming\nSun's narrative is combined a limited number\
    \ of details mention by Linton\nin \"Sacrifice to the Morning Star by the Skidi\
    \ Pawnee.\"\nAs already stated, Morning Star ruled in the east and Evening Star\
    \ in\nthe west.  All the stars west of the Milky Way were feminine and those to\n\
    the east were masculine, but the most powerful were Morning Star and\nEvening\
    \ Star.  Sun was with the former and Moon was a companion of the\nlatter.  One\
    \ after another the eastern star came to court the stars in the\nwest, in order\
    \ that man might be placed on the earth.  Moon welcomed them\nand walked with\
    \ them toward the west, but as soon as they came in sight of\nthe village she\
    \ caused the ground to open so the man fell through and was\nkilled.  At last\
    \ Morning Star resolved to go and woo the great Evening Star,\ntaking his little\
    \ brother along to carry his pack.  Thus, according to\nComing Sun, a small star\
    \ always appears near and slightly below the\nmorning star in the spring, representing\
    \ the little brother.  Linton,\nhowever, states that Morning Star was accompanied\
    \ by Sun, who carried a\nsacred bundle with a war club.\nTen obstacles were encountered\
    \ by Morning Star and his companion, the\nfirst five being difficulties of travel,\
    \ such as sharp flints and sword\ngrass beneath their feet, and the last five\
    \ being animals which attached\nthem, including the mountain lion, wildcat, buffalo,\
    \ and bear.  All these\nwere placed in their way by Moon, who thought she could\
    \ conquer them as\nshe had conquered the others.  But Morning Star carried a ball\
    \ encased in\nsuch a manner that when he threw it the casing broke and it became\
    \ a ball\nof fire.  When throwing the ball he sang the following song, which was\n\
    said to be one of the principal songs in the ceremony.  Linton states that\nMorning\
    \ Star struck the ground with his war club, closing the cracks made\nby Moon for\
    \ his destruction, and that he sang a song with substantially the\nsame words\
    \ recorded by Coming Sun.\nThe tenth obstacle was not encountered by Morning Star\
    \ until after he\nentered the lodge of Evening Star.  The obstacle was a snake,\
    \ but he\novercame it, as he had overcome the others, by means of the ball of\
    \ fire\nand the song.\nEven Star saw that his power was greater than heres, but\
    \ she determined\nto hold him aloof as long as possible.  Finally, she insisted\
    \ that he make\nprovision for the child that should be born; she even required\
    \ him to\nprovide perfumed water for bathing the child and a cradle board in which\n\
    it should be placed.  On the hoop, or arch, of this cradle board was\npainted\
    \ a morning star and the lightnings, this custom being followed by\nthe Pawnee\
    \ at the present time.  Evening Star also required him to plant a\ntree in front\
    \ of the lodge so that the mocking birds might nest there and\nsing to the child.\
    \  From this union a daughter was born.  She cam down to\nearth and wandered about\
    \ in fear.  As she was running hither and thither she\nmet a boy, the child of\
    \ Sun and Moon, and these two became the ancestors of\nthe human race.\nMorning\
    \ Star made a bundle and placed in it various articles connected\nwith the obstacles\
    \ he had overcome on his westward journey.  He left this\nbundle with Evening\
    \ Star and for that reason a woman has always been the\nkeeper of the sacred bundle.\
    \  Other articles have been added from time to\ntime and will be noted in this\
    \ paper.\nIt is said that Evening Star required a human sacrifice as her reward.\n\
    This sacrifice must be a pure and beautiful maiden and she demanded that\nthe\
    \ sacrifice be repeated annually.  Long ago, Morning Star sometimes\nappeared\
    \ to a man in a dream and told him to secure a maiden for this\nsacrifice.  According\
    \ to Linton, a man who had this vision went to the\nkeeper of the Morning Star\
    \ bundle and received the warrior's costume and\nthe sacred objects kept for such\
    \ an expedition.  Other warriors joined him\nand, preliminary to the expedition,\
    \ they enacted the journey of the\nMorning Star, and sang the song with which\
    \ he overcame the obstacles placed\nin his way. (Cf. Song No. 1)  When the ceremony\
    \ ended it was almost time\nfor the Morning Star to rise and the leader went outside\
    \ the lodge and\naddressed an invocation to him.  After dancing furiously around\
    \ their fire\nand offering a last prayer to Morning Star the warriors started\
    \ forth and\ncaptured a maiden from the enemy.  Returning, they gave her into\
    \ the care\nof the chief of the Morning Star village until the time for her sacrifice.\n\
    She was treated in a ceremonial manner but kept in ignorance of her fate.\nAt\
    \ the appointed time her body was painted, half red and half black, and\nshe was\
    \ tied to a scaffold and shot through the heart with an arrow.  It\nwas said that\
    \ the braided thong used to bind the girl to the scaffold is\nnow in the Morning\
    \ Star bundle.\nTradition states that on one occasion the intended victim was\
    \ rescued.\nOn the night preceding her execution she was seated beside some tall\n\
    sunflowers.  A young chief came through the tall weed and stole her away,\nputting\
    \ her on his horse and taking her to Fort Leavenworth, whence she\nwas returned\
    \ to her own people.  She died within three months, having\nbeen anointed for\
    \ death with the sacred ointment of red paint and buffalo\nfat.  This occurred\
    \ about the year 1818.  The man who rescued the intended\nvictim was a warrior\
    \ of distinction and through his influence the custom\nwas discontinued.  The\
    \ ritual of the sacrifice is still rendered but no\nactual sacrifice has taken\
    \ place since that date.\nComing Sun, who sings the ceremonial songs, said that\
    \ sometimes, during\nthe Morning Star ceremony he stops and says \"Listen,\" and\
    \ the people hear\na woman's voice singing the songs above his head.\nThe Morning\
    \ Star ceremony was held by the Skidi Band near Pawnee,\nOkla., on April 17, 1920.\
    \  This ceremony formerly lasted four days and\nnights, ending when the morning\
    \ star appeared in the east, but at the\npresent time it is concluded in one day.\
    \  On this occasion the writer\nhad the honor of entering the lodge, through the\
    \ courtesy of Coming Sun.\nIt is said that one other white person, Dr. G. A. Dorsey,\
    \ has entered the\nlodge during the ceremony and seen the contents of the sacred\
    \ bundle.\nThe ceremony was held in a tipi erected for the occasion in a quiet\n\
    spot near the house of the keeper of the bundle, north of Pawnee.  This\ntipi\
    \ has been used in the Ghost dance and was decorated with Ghost dance\nsymbols.\
    \  The adjacent landscape is shown in Plate 3,c.  The ceremony\nbegan at about\
    \ 9 a.m. and continued until 4 p.m., the writer sitting\noutside the tipi except\
    \ for the brief time she was permitted to enter.\nThus the entire songs of the\
    \ ceremony were heard, as well as the prayers\nand rituals, though only the principal\
    \ song was obtained.  At the proper\ntime Coming Sun, who was in charge of the\
    \ ceremony, sent a message to\nsummon the writer and she entered the lodge, passing\
    \ to the right and\nstanding near the bundle before which she laid gifts of calico,\
    \ tobacco,\nand money.  Coming Sun was seated back of the bundle, directly opposite\n\
    the entrance, and held one of the sacred gourd rattles.  Two men at either\nside\
    \ of him held similar rattles.  In front of the men at Coming Sun's\nleft and\
    \ next [to] the sacred bundle was a belt decorated \nXXX[page23]"

  description: "The ceremony of Painting the Buffalo Skull is held every spring by\
    \ the\nChaui Band of Pawnee and is in charge of Mr. Stacy Matlock, a prominent\n\
    member of that band.  The closing events of the ceremony are the Buffalo\nand\
    \ Lance dances, which were witnessed by the writer through the courtesy\nof Mr.\
    \ Matlock, no other white person being present.  The ceremony and\ndances were\
    \ held in a large earth lodge, several miles south of the town\nof Pawnee.  The\
    \ opening of the lodge was toward the east.  At some\ndistance was a framework,\
    \ probably that of a sweat lodge.  Only members\nof the Buffalo Society were admitted\
    \ to the painting of the skull, but\nduring the Buffalo dance the skull painted\
    \ a few days previously, lay on\na folded blanket in front of the \"altar\" which\
    \ was opposite the entrance.\nThis occasion and the Lance dance held a few days\
    \ later afforded exceptional\nopportunities to listen to Pawnee songs, but the\
    \ semidarkness of the lodge\nand the solemnity of the occasion precluded the taking\
    \ of notes upon either\nthe music or the details of the ceremonial dances.\nThe\
    \ chief singer at both of these dances was Wicita Blain, a blind man\nwho received\
    \ the songs by inheritance.  He led the songs which were sung\nat a certain position\
    \ back of the altar.  At a later time he recorded the\nceremonial songs here presented,\
    \ also certain songs of the Bear dance,\nwhich is held in equally high esteem\
    \ by the Pawnee.  John Luwak, chief of\nthe Chaui Band, was prominent at the Lance\
    \ dance and later recorded \nnumerous songs, including those of the Crow Lance\
    \ Society.\nThe following song was led by Mr. Blain at the Buffalo dance attended\n\
    by the writer and is a very old song concerning Mrs. Blain's uncle, whose\nname\
    \ was Naru'dapadi.  A great herd of buffalo came to the place where\nthe Indians\
    \ were encamped and threatened the destruction of the village.\nHer uncle rode\
    \ toward them, shouting and firing his gun in an attempt to\ndivert them from\
    \ their course, but he was caught in the herd.  There were\nbuffalo on all sides\
    \ of him as the herd swept through the camp and across\na stream, carrying him\
    \ with them."

  description: 'Long ago an old man named Nara''dudesa''ru had a dream

    and in his dream he saw a cloud of dust rolling along

    the ground.  He sat and looked at the dust a long

    time until late in the afternoon.  Then it looked

    like a crowd of people, but after the dust storm

    had passed he saw a great herd of buffalo.'

  description: 'The next song is also concerning a dream of buffalo.

    The herd was scattered and a man was watching them.

    One of the buffalo lay down.  The man wondered

    why the buffalo had lain down.  That night he

    dreamed about the buffalo, who said that he had

    "taken pitch" on the man.  The buffalo promised

    the man that he would live to old age and be

    able to foretell events a long time before

    they came to pass.'

  description: 'At a certain point in the Lance dance witnessed

    by the writer the decorated lances were carried

    around the lodge and the following song was sung.

    This constituted one of the most impressive portions

    of the ceremony.  The song is very old and belonged

    to a woman who had two sons, the song being sung

    whenever they danced.  The woman lived to be so

    old that she could not stand erect but she

    "was always singing this song while she was cooking

    or working."  The words mean "Father, the band of the

    dead is coming."  The woman who recorded the song

    was blind.'

  description: 'The next song was sung when all the participants

    in the Bear dance were seated.  "Mother" was said

    to refer to the moon, and there was said to be a

    similar song containing the word "Father."  A young

    man received this song in a dream, while mourning

    for his parents who had died.  He saw a woman coming

    toward him, and said, "Mother is coming."  The woman

    said, "You have seen me, now you must learn this song."

    The young man learned the song, lived a long time

    afterwards, and took part in the Bear dance.  When

    the song is used ceremonially there are six "stops"

    or verses, the general meaning of which is as follows:

    1. "Mother is coming."

    2. The young man, devotional by nature, imagines that he

    is still mourning for his parents.

    3. "Mother stands yonder."

    4. The young man says, "Mother, standing in the sky, I

    want you to take pitch on me."

    5. "Mother now ends" (stands still).

    6. "I will now say, I mean the mother who alone stands

    forever in the sky" (the moon).'

  description: 'In the next song we have an expression of the belief

    that a bear derives his "medicine power" from the sun

    and that the center of that power is in his palms.

    He stands facing the dawn in order that the first

    rays of the sun may strike his paws, upheld for the

    purpose.  In this manner he renews his power from

    the sun.

    An old man named Lata''piu, long ago, fell asleep, and

    when he awoke he saw a strange sight.  The sun was rising

    and a bear was pointing at the sunrise.  The old man

    made this song about his vision and whenever he saw the

    sunrise he sang the song.  Ever since that time the

    song has been used in the Bear dance.'

    with this aid he could scarcely walk.  This old man had

    a dream in which he ascended a high hill and sat down.

    The clouds were below him and he saw rain falling from

    the clouds; he also saw about 40 white horses and

    drove them; the white horses were probably the shapes

    assumed by the clouds in his dream.  The following song

  description: 'The general idea of the next song is that it is better

    to die bravely when young that to live to an enfeebled

    old age.  In this, as in other Pawnee war songs, we see

    a light estimate upon the value of life as compared to

    success in war.  The song belonged originally to a

    brave man who lived to an advanced age.  When this

    was sung in a dance he rose and told the young men

    that it was a painful thing to live to be so old.

    The song was also sung by men in a battle, this being

    the last song they sang "when they were all tired out

    and so nearly beaten that even their hair was disheveled."

    It was further stated that "sometimes when men were

    having this dance an enemy attacked the village.

    This was the song they sang as they drove the enemy away."

    The song was also used in the scalp dances that followed

    the return of a successful war party.'

  description: 'The dance of the Raven Lance Society was said to be

    "almost like that in which the dancers painted half

    their bodies red and half black,"

    referring to the

    <A href="white.lance.society.html">White Lance Society.</A.

    The original owner of this dance lived to extreme old

    age and, as he had no children, he gave the dance to a

    young man who was one of his nearest relatives.

    One day the people said, "Some Indians are coming to

    attack us."

    The young man who had received the dance took his raven

    lance, mounted his pony, and went to get the old man.

    They rode together on the pony to a place near the

    fight and then went forward on foot, but the old man

    could not go as fast as the warriors.  The old man

    called, "I am still coming," and the young man came

    back and helped him forward.

    The aged man was proud to see that the young man to

    whom he had given his dance was among the leaders in

    the fight.  The enemy shot and killed the young man,

    and the lance was brought back with his body.  Then

    the old man sang this song.  In the manner of recording

    the song there was a wailing which was said to be

    "the old man crying because the young man had been

    killed and he had no more relatives," yet he loved the

    lance and all that it symbolized.  He died soon afterwards

    and, as he was too old to give the dance to anyone else,

    the Pawnee do not have the dance at the present time.'

  description: 'In explanation of the following song it was said that long ago

    there was a society called Iruska Virau (or Pirau), translated

    "children of the Iruska."  Members of this society did everything

    contrariwise.  Thus in a fight they would not fire at the enemy

    unless commanded NOT to do so.  The song next following was said

    to be a song of that society and was recorded by the chief of the

    Chaui Band.  The same melody with different words was used by the

    Skidi Band, the words of their version stating that a young man

    was told in a dream that he would be killed the next day, but

    felt no fear.  John Luwak, who recorded the song, said it was

    his own war-dance song, explaining the words as follows: "A dead

    person wanted a certain warrior to do right, so he said to him,

    `If anyone is kind-hearted and good to the poor he is made a chief

    and has a great name.  When he dies we in the spirit land are glad

    and want to go and meet him because he was kind and good."'

  description: 'The following song was also sung while the game was in progress.

    In explanation it was said, "This song belonged to a man who died

    long ago.  He had one daughter and she died.  The old man cried

    every day but at last, one night, he heard a cry in the woods.  It

    was his daughter, who said, `Father, I am in heaven.''  Afterwards

    he did not cry any more."'

  description: 'Long ago, when the Pawnee "used to go traveling," they stopped

    at night to rest and frequently played the hand game.  Among them

    was a little boy, too young to play, who loved to watch the game.

    He was so little that he wore no clothing.  As soon as night came

    this little boy ran to get wood and made a big fire so that everyone

    would come and play the hand game.  He did not even want to eat

    was so anxious for them to play.  The men made this song about the

    little body and sang it as they played the game.'

  description: 'The hypnotic phase which the hand game has in common with the

    Ghost dance is indicated in the following song which was sung at

    the Ghost dance and also at the hand game.  In old times the game

    and its accompanying dances were held on the prairie instead of

    inside a lodge.  A portion of the people were called "crows," and

    the woman who recorded this song said that she "belonged on the

    crow side of the circle."  At intervals these people gave the caw

    of the crow and imitated that bird in their dancing.  (This was

    done in the dance connected with the hand game attended by the

    writer.)  It is said that under the hypnotic influence of the

    occasion, the dancers sometimes saw a crow inside the dance circle,

    no one except themselves being able to see it.  The singer said

    that she "dreamed" this song when she was a young girl.'

  description: 'This and the succeeding song were not used in the hand game.  The

    singer said that he composed this song when waking from a trance in

    the Ghost dance.  He dreamed of a yellow star which came to him and

    said, "I am the star which you see in the sky at night."  The star

    was in the form of a woman holding in her hand an eagle feather

    painted yellow.  She gave him the feather, saying, "All the stars in

    the sky are people."  A dream of the yellow star was induced by

    watching the star when in a ghost dance trance.  The favor of "yellow

    star" was greatly desired as she does not appear to many dancers, but

    she gives to her favored friends the right to wear a yellow eagle

    feather upright in their hair and to use it in hypnotizing other

    dancers.  If such a feather is used under a false pretense no results

    can be obtained.'

  description: 'The man to whom the next song belonged was Running Scout, a man who

    was very religious and remained in a Ghost dance trance for several

    days.  His friends thought him unbalanced but when he awoke he told

    them that he had been to the Messiah who told him to "go to the

    village."  Following this instruction, he saw many men dancing.  Some

    had fox skins around their heads while others used fox skins in

    hypnotizing their fellow dancers.  For this reason Running Scout always

    wore a fox skin in the Ghost dance.  The skin was not made into a cap

    but the head and tail were fastened together and hung at the back of

    his neck in such a manner that the tail rested on his shoulder.

    He also gave the call of the fox while he was dancing.'

    songs were attributed.  According to the singer, Man Chief was

    chief of the four bands of Pawnee and died in 1858 at the age of

    74 years.  concerning the next song it was said, "When we first

    elected Man Chief as chief he thanked God, and then he sang this

  description: 'Man Chief received numerous songs in dreams.  The first song is

    a war dance of the Iruska, it being said that the "spirits told

    him about this dance, which is different from an ordinary war dance."

    This society corresponds to the Hethushka of the Omaha, a society

    of distinguished warriors.  Before recording this song Luwak recorded

    the following sentences: "The song which I am about to sing belonged

    to Man Chief.  When he became a chief he used to go out into the

    storm and stand first in one place and then in another.  He heard

    Tirawa speak through the clouds.  He knew the heavens were the

    ruling power and prayed for his people."  While speaking, he beat

    the drum in the same tempo as in the song which followed.'

  description: 'The two songs next following belong to a comparatively recent

    chief of the Chaui Band.  The grief of his wife at the death of a

    daughter is mentioned in connection with her song (No. 83).  Roaming

    Chief was hereditary chief of this band and was a nephew of the

    famous Pitalesaru, who was appointed chief of the confederated

    bands of the Pawnee by the Government of the United States.

    It was said that "Tirawa had pitch on Roaming Chief" and that,

    during a Ghost dance, he fell in a trance.  Visions appeared to him

    in this trance, the present song referring to such an experience.

    A Ghost dance was sometimes held especially for Roaming Chief and

    he "cried as he sang this song."  It was also customary to sing

    this song at a hand game.'

  description: 'Mr. James R. Murie and other old members of the tribe said that love

    songs, in the white man''s use of the term, were unknown among the

    better class of Pawnee in the early days.  According to Mr. Murie,

    there were four classes of Pawnee, the lowest being considered outcasts

    by the remainder of the tribe.  These people camped near towns and

    worked for white people, from whom they obtained whisky.  This class

    of Pawnee sang what were termed "crazy people''s songs," which were

    associated with "love charms" and evil influences.  No effort was

    made to secure examples of these songs.  A change from the former

    attitude toward women, however, is shown in the following song which

    was said to be very old.  It is not of so low a character as the

    "crazy people''s songs," neither does it represent the high standard

    of life indicated in the former songs of this group.  A girl married

    a man for whom she did not care and it would appear that, instead of

    adapting himself to the situation, he sought consolation elsewhere.'

  description: 'In a certain village were two young boys.  They were good-looking

    lads and wore their hair long on the right side of the head.  One day

    the younger boy thought he would go to another village in the woods.

    When he came near this village he saw the smoke of a tipi that stood

    by itself among the willows.  He went there and stood outside the entrance.

    In this tipi lived an old woman and her three granddaughters.  The old

    woman told the youngest girl to go outside and see if anyone was there.

    the girl saw the strange lad and returned, saying "O grandmother, there

    is a good-looking young man outside."  The old woman wanted to speak with

    him and said, ''You had better go to some village where the people have money.

    We are very poor."  But the lad replied, "No. I cam here and this is where

    I belong."  The old woman said, "Well, come in," and the boy entered the

    tipi.  Later the old woman said, "You had better go away for the chief of

    our band is very unkind to strangers.  You must watch, for Longnose (Coyote)

    will come before daylight to see if anyone is here.  He will see you and

    tell the chief, who will ask you to breakfast.  If he offers you dry

    pumpkin do not eat it, nor corn, nor mush.  Bring it home with you."

    Before daylight, as the old woman had predicted, Coyote came to see if

    anyone was in the tipi.  The old woman said, "See my grandson, how

    good-looking he is.  He ought to go where the big men are."  Coyote ran

    at once to the chief and said, "O chief, there is a good looking young

    man down at the old woman''s tipi.  When you kill him he will be the leader

    of your heads."  (Referring to a row of the heads of men killed by the

    chief that had been put in his tipi.)  The chief said, "Run down to the old

    woman''s tipi and bring the young man.  I want to feast him."  Coyote ran

    as fast as he could.  The old woman saw him coming and again told the

    young man not to eat anything but to bring the food home.  Coyote said to

    the young man, "You certainly are good-looking."  When the chief saw the

    young man he said, "I sent for you to eat with me," and offered him dry

    pumpkin, corn, much, and other food.  The lad replied, "O grandfather, I

    am full; I have had my breakfast; I will take this home to my grandmother."

    Coyote went with him and waited while the old woman emptied and washed

    the bowls.  Then Coyote took the bowls back to the chief.  After the boy

    refused to eat the food, the chief wanted him to play the "stick game."

    He refused at first but finally he said that he would play in two days,

    saying he must wait because he was so tired.  The chief said, "Choose a

    day and we will play."  The boy went home and told the old woman that he

    was to play the stick game with the chief.  She said, "O my boy, you did

    wrong to consent.  You saw those heads in the chief''s tent.  He will kill

    you and all our people."

    Before daylight on the day of the game Coyote opened the old woman''s door

    and said, "The chief is at the place for the game, he is waiting for you."

    The boy replied, "I will go when I am ready."  Later they began to play

    the stick game.  The boy had people on his side and also a bird-man

    (bird turned into a man), who watched everything.  Coyote watched

    everything on the chief''s side.  the boy had nothing to wager so he bet

    the people who were on his side, and at last he was obliged to bet himself.

    The old chief won, so the people on the chief''s side killed all the people

    on the boy''s side.  They even killed the boy.  Then they cut off all the

    heads and put them up with the other heads in the chief''s lodge.

    While this was happening the elder of the two boys, mentioned at the

    beginning of this story, grew uneasy about his brother.  He determined

    to find him and traced him to the village, then he went home, got his

    bow and arrows, and went to the old woman''s tipi.  The old woman did

    as before, sending the same girl to see if anyone were outside.  The

    girl returned and said, "It looks as though that good-looking boy had

    come to life."  The old woman invited him into the tend but said as

    before, "O my grandson, why do you come here.  You ought to go where

    the rich people are."  He replied as his brother had done, "No, I want

    to be here."  They were so poor that they gave him only one bean from

    those they had gathered.  At night the old woman said as before, "O my

    grandson, I wish you would go away.  Go somewhere else or go home, for

    someone will come early in the morning to look all around the place."

    Everything happened exactly as before.  Coyote came, found the young

    man, and took him to the chief, who offered him food.  The young man

    replied, as his brother had done, that he was not hungry, and he took the

    food home.  The chief asked him to play the stick game and he said that

    he was too tired to play that day.  It was decided that they would play in

    a few days.  The boy went home and said to his grandmother, "I am going to

    play the stick game with the chief.  To-morrow I want you to clean up the

    house and put everything one side, then I want you all to go into the woods.

    Do not try to look into the house until I call you."  Then he asked, "Is

    there any place around here where the people used to kill buffalo?"

    She replied, "Yes, over there by the hill."

    After they had gone the young man took the pipe out of the sacred bundle

    that the old woman kept.  Before daylight he filled the pipe and went toward

    the place where they used to kill the buffalo.  When he reached the place

    he found many buffalo bones.  He held the stem of the pipe down toward the

    buffalo bones and sang the following song.'

  description: 'As the young man sang [the previous] song [No. 72] the bones came
    to life

    and made a noise like a great many buffalo.  He said, "Now, fathers,

    grandfathers and grandmothers, I want you to pity me.  That is why I sang."

    They replied, "All right."  Then a middle-aged buffalo with shining horns

    came toward him and said, "I will be the first to help you.  We know about

    the wicked chief and what he has been doing."  The buffalo threw himself down

    down and when he got up he shook himself.  Where he had been lying the boy

    saw a game stick.  The buffalo said, "Take this stick."  A young buffalo

    did the same and gave the boy another stick.  Then a young buffalo cow did

    the same and when she arose the boy saw a game ring which she told him

    to use.  The boy brought the two sticks and the ring home with him and

    hung them beside the sacred bundle.  On the day of the game he told his

    grandmother that he would send someone for the sticks and the ring but

    did not want anyone to be at home when the messenger came.

    In the morning Coyote came as before and said that all was ready for the

    game.  Everything was the same as when the younger man played, the chief

    having Coyote and the man having the bird-man on his side.  They began

    to play and the chief won as before.  The boy had no goods so he bet the

    people, as his brother had done.  The chief said, "Now you have bet all

    the people, you ought to bet yourself."  The young man said "All right."

    Then his stick struck the chief''s stick and broke it in two.  The young

    man said, "Thanks.  Now I will not be killed."  The chief said, "Perhaps

    you have some gaming sticks somewhere."  The man said, "Yes," and sent

    Coyote to get them, adding, "They are common sticks, lying on the floor."

    Coyote went to the old woman''s lodge, opened the door and heard a noise

    as of many buffalo.  He was frightened and ran back.  The chief sent

    another messenger, who brought the same report.  Then the boy sent the

    bird-man, who brought the sticks and the ring.  They did not make any

    noise when he entered the lodge for they knew he was the right person.

    The boy played with the sticks and had good luck.  He won back all the

    people, and the chief''s leg was broken.  Then the boy sang this song.

    They played again and the chief said, "Throw the sticks toward the east."

    They threw the sticks toward the east and the boy''s stick went through

    the hoop and went on and on, and finally it turned into a buffalo.  As

    soon as the chief''s people saw the stick turn into a buffalo they began

    to cry, but the boy''s people began to rejoice.

    The young man asked, "Where is my brother''s head?"  They told him.

    He asked, "Where are his bones?"  They told him this also.  Then he

    laid his brother''s bones in order on the ground, with the head at one end.

    Then he stood below his brother''s foot and kicked the foot, saying,

    "Why are you sleeping so long?"  His brother arose and said, "Yes, I have

    been asleep a long time," and smoothed his hair.

    They killed the chief where the game had been played and they killed all

    the chief''s people.  Then the two brother returned to their own village.'

  description: 'There was a village and a man who used to run around by himself.  He
    was

    Coyote.  He went and sat on a hill looking down and he saw a big flock

    of turkeys.  He was hungry, as coyotes always are, and he thought, "I am

    going to get one of them."  So he went down.  The turkeys nudged each

    other and said, "There comes a thief."  He looks hungry.  We must look

    out for him.  He is tricky."  They all said that.  Coyote said to the

    turkeys, "Grandchildren, let us have a little game."  The turkeys said,

    "What kind of game are we going to have?"  Coyote said, "Well, don''t let

    us have a game, let us have a dance."  The turkeys said, "All right, let

    us have a dance."

    Coyote looked at the turkeys.  Some were big, fat ones.  He selected about

    six of the biggest and fattest and said, "You must stand in front."  Then

    he arranged two rows back of them.  Then said, "I have a song.  While you

    dance you must close your eyes.  When I begin to sing you must all close

    your eyes."  He kept his eyes open and he say one turkey with its eyes

    open.  He said, "Close your eyes, you are looking at me."  He sang again,

    and after a while he saw they all had their eyes shut.  He had a club in

    his hand but he kept on singing.  The turkeys all had their eyes shut and

    he killed all in the front row.  The rest flew away before he could kill

    them.  The he said that he would have a feast for his wives and his

    children.  He said, "Turkeys have not much sense."'

  description: 'Story of Nuri and His Brother.

    Related by Mrs. Mary Murie.

    The narrator of [this] story said that it did not originate with the

    Pawnee and she thought that it came from the Omaha in Nebraska.

    There was a man so jealous of his wife that he determined to take her

    away from the village.  He told her to pack everything and they would go.

    They took plenty of dried meat, pounded meat, corn, and all kinds of food,

    and left the village.  When night came they camped.  They were far from

    any people and her husband said they would stay in that place.  He was a

    good hunter and killed deer, turkeys, and other game.  After a while they

    made an earth lodge to live in.  Every morning the man put plenty of meat

    beside the fire, brought some water, and told his wife to stay in the lodge

    until his return.  He was gone until night.

    In time his wife bore a child and named it Nuri.  Indeed she bore twin

    boys, but her husband did not notice the second child and buried it with

    the afterbirth.  The second child crawled out of the ground and lived

    with the animals, but his mother never knew.  Her husband told her, as

    before, that she must stay in the lodge.  He said that he had seen some

    bad people prowling about.  One day, when the man was away, these bad

    people cam to the lodge.  His wife was sitting beside the fire and the

    baby was asleep when she heard a sound and looked toward the door.  Even

    men entered the lodge and said, "Give us something to eat.  We know that

    you have plenty of food."  She did not reply but pointed to the meat that

    was cooking on sticks around the fire.  They ate it all and went away.

    After they had gone she exclaimed, "Those horrid men ate all my meat."

    One heard it and said to the others, "She called us names."  So they all

    went into the lodge and killed her.  They did not see the baby but they

    carried the woman''s body to their camp and devoured it.  When the man

    came home he looked for his wife, and seeing the tracks he knew the wicked

    people had taken her.  The man grieved greatly for his wife.

    By this time the baby was old enough to walk and walk.  Every morning

    before the man went to hunt he fixed the meat ready to cook and told the

    little boy to play inside the lodge.  One day he went away as usual, after

    fixing the meat, and the little boy thought, "I will go outside.  I never

    have seen what it is like out there."  He went out and saw a little boy

    coming toward him.  The boy was about his own size and was singing the

    following song.  [story continued in next song]'

  description: '[story continued from previous song]

    The strange boy (who was his brother) said, "Nuri, you are having a

    good time with your father but I am here with my grandmothers, the wood

    rates.  Your father is my father too.  I have plenty of wild grapes and

    cherries but I do not have any meat to eat."  Nuri said, "Come into the

    lodge and I will give you some."  The strange boy sniffed the air and

    asked, "Is your father here?"  "No," said Nuri.  The strange boy went into

    the lodge and played until it was time for their father to return.  Then

    he ran away, saying, "Forget, forget," so that Nuri would not tell their

    father.  This child was a "wonder boy" and he came every day until both

    boys were quite grown.  One day he failed to say "Forget" when he went

    away.  As the boy and his father were eating their supper Nuri said,

    "Father, I want to tell you something.  There is a little boy who comes

    every day to play with me while you are away."  The man said to himself,

    "I will try to catch the boy."  So one morning he hid instead of going

    away.  The wonder boy came as usual, singing the same little song.  He

    stopped and sniffed the air, saying to Nuri, "Your father is here."  "No,"

    said Nuri, "Perhaps you smell his blanket."  "It is certainly he," said the

    boy, and ran away.  The father determined to catch the boy by a trick and

    told Nuri how to tie a thong around his brother''s scalplock.  In the

    struggle that ensued the wonder-boy''s scalplock was torn from his head

    and held by the thong.  The father kept the scalplock gave the boys a good

    supper, and told them to stay in the lodge.

    Nuri obeyed his father, but as time passed, his brother continually

    tried to lead him into danger.  When Nuri objected his brother would say,

    "Give me my hair and I will go back to my grandmothers."  Then Nuri would

    yield, but the boys always returned in safety.  One day they brought

    snake rattles and hung them on the door of the lodge.  Another day they

    went to a place where a boat was moored.  If anyone went in his boat it

    upset, threw the people into the water, and then returned to its place by

    the shore.  The wonder boy wanted to go in the boat but Nuri objected.

    The boy said as before, "Then you must give me my hair and I will go back

    to my grandmothers."  Nuri yielded and they went in the boat, which soon

    began tipping endwise and sidewise.  "Do as I do," cried the wonder-boy,

    moving his arms and making a noise like a wild goose.  Nuri imitated him

    and the boys flew away.  Before leaving the boat they sand the following

    song.

    After they flew away the boat returned to the landing.

    Then the wonder boy wanted to go where the people lived who killed his

    mother.  These people lived in straw huts and when they saw the boys they

    said, "These boys are fat; we will have a good feast."  The wonder boy

    heard them talking.  They called to the boys and said, "Come in soon, we

    will have the feast ready," and aside they said, "The boys have no sense."

    Nuri was afraid but his brother said, "Do not cry.  We will destroy them.

    If we do not they will kill us."  The boys went into the lodge and saw a

    kettle full of boiling water.  The wonder boy said, "Do as I do."  Then

    both boys jumped on the edge of the kettle and upset it.  The boiling

    water fell on the people but the boys flew out of the lodge like burned

    leaves.  The people fought and killed one another, thinking they were

    killing the boys, and the lodge burned up.  These people had long sharp

    bones at the points of their elbows and heels and on the back of their

    heads.  When they were dead the boys took off three or four of these

    points.  The wonder boy said, "Let us take these home for farther to use

    in sewing moccasins."

    This frightened the father and that night he made up his mind to run

    away and leave the boys.  The wonder boy knew that his father would do

    this but Nuri cried the next morning, when his father had gone.  The

    brother said, "Father has left us but we will search until we find him."

    So the boys started to find their father.  At first they saw no trace,

    and whenever they met a snake, a bear, or even a little but the wonder

    boy would ask, "Have you seen my father?"  They replied "No."  After the

    boys had traveled a long time the brother said to Nuri, "Are you tired?"

    Nuri said that he was tired, and his brother summoned a tiger (mountain

    lion?) and both boys rode on his back.  When they had traveled a long way

    farther they came to a village and asked, "Have you seen our father?"  The

    people replied, "Yes, we saw him going north."  The boys traveled all

    that night but could not find him.  The brother said, "Let us kill all the

    people in every village."  Nuri cried, but yielded.  The wonder boy said,

    "Nur, do this."  The boys turned their heads from side to side and they

    rattled.  They said to the people, "If you see us you will die, and if

    you do not see us you will die."  The people fell over and died, one after

    another.  Then the boys looked all through the village but could not find

    their father.  At the third village they found that their father had been

    killed by the people.  Huri cried but his brother said, "I would not cry.

    He left us to starve."  They found their father''s body and took it away

    to a high hill.  They cut two willow poles, two cottonwood, two elm, and

    two walnut poles, and four cedar posts about as long as the height of a

    man.  They worked all day doing this, and took them on the hill.  Then

    they laid them crosswise in a pile with sweet grass underneath and put

    their father''s body on top of the pile.  The wonder boy said, "Father,

    we used to love you but now we are going to burn you up and the smoke

    will ascend to Tirawa; but, father, you are not dead forever, and some

    day we will see you again."'

  description: "Story of the Little Rattlesnake\nThis story differs from the preceding\
    \ in that the entire narrative was\nsung, a typical portion of the melody begin\
    \ transcribed.  The story was\nas follows:  In the place where the rattlesnakes\
    \ lived there was a little\nrattlesnake who cried because he wanted his rattle\
    \ to make a noise.  He\nsaid to his father, \"I do not see why I don't rattle.\
    \  I am just like my\nbrothers and sisters but their rattles rattle while mine\
    \ does not.\"  His\nfather said, \"You are not old enough.  When you are as big\
    \ as your\nbrothers and sisters your rattle will rattle like theirs.\"\nThe little\
    \ snake cried so hard that at last they \"made medicine\" for\nhim so that his\
    \ rattle would rattle.  Then he wanted to rattle it all\nthe time.\nThe little\
    \ snake said to his father, \"Tell me how a chief's daughter\nlooks.  I want to\
    \ bite her foot.\"  His father said, \"A chief's daughter \nis very neat in her\
    \ dress.  Those who are not the daughters of chiefs are\nvery careless  You can\
    \ tell the difference in that way.\"\nThe snakes' house was located on a road\
    \ along which the Pawnee used\nto travel.  The oldest snake said, \"Father, my\
    \ little brother rattles all\nthe time.  The Pawnee will hear him and kill us\
    \ all.  Make him stop.\"\nBut the little snake kept on.  He even went beside the\
    \ road and rattled\nhis rattle very loud.\nOne day a girl came along the road\
    \ and the little snake thought she\nwas the chief's daughter.  He bit her foot\
    \ and she turned quickly and\ncrushed his head.  The other snakes found him and\
    \ the brother said,\n\"Father, didn't I tell you that one of us would be killed?\

    since that time he had prayed morning and night.'

  description: 'Mr. Murie said that the story concerning the following song was recently

    told him by John Luwak: A man and his wife had one child, a daughter, who

    had many admirers.  Sirirut Kawi (Pushed Forward) entered the lodge

    early one morning, after the manner of young men courting a maiden.

    The man said to his wife, "Did you notice that young man?"

    He came again, and then the woman said to her husband.  "The young man

    is handsome, he comes of a good family, he has plenty of horses and

    his arms are strong so that he would be good to support us."  When he

    came the third time they told him to wait for his answer until the girl''s

    relatives could discuss the matter.  So they called their relatives

    together, the mother''s relatives being seated on the south and the

    father''s on the north side of the lodge.  The father''s relatives left

    the decision to the mother''s relatives, who decided that the girl should

    be allowed to marry the young man.  Many presents were distributed.

    The young man''s relatives gave presents, and the young man gave a fine

    horse to the father and mother of the girl.  The next day the old man

    gave the horse to his wife.  There were buffalo robes and many valuable

    articles among the presents.

    All went well for a time, and then the young man began to beat his wife

    and abuse her.  The girl''s mother begged her father to interfere, but

    he refused to do so.  She said, "You claim to be a brave man; why do

    you not make our son-in-law stop beating his wife?"

    He said, "Do you remember one beautiful morning when you said the

    young man was handsome, that he came of good family, had many horses,

    and his arms were strong?"

    "Yes."

    "Do you remember that my relatives sat on the north and yours on the

    south side of the lodge, and that my relatives left the decision to

    yours?"

    "Yes."

    "So your people sold our daughter to that man.  We have no right to

    interfere with his property.  He gave the ponies.  He gave a fine pony

    to us.  Didn''t I give you that pony?"

    "Yes."

    "Get a kettle.  Put it on the fire and put water in it."  She did so.

    "Now take your parfleche bag and put the finest of your dried meat in

    the pot.  When the soup is done you must bring me some in a wooden bowl."

    When she brought the soup he told her to sit beside him and eat.  As

    they ate he said, "What nice fat!  What fine meat this is!  Who got it

    for you?"

    "Our son-in-law."

    "You like the meat that our son-in-law brings us?  He punishes our

    daughter for her own good.  He does not want her to run around the camp

    foolishly.  He wants her to be a good cook and to look after things in

    the lodge."

    Then the woman stopped finding fault with her son-in-law.

    The young man was well liked by the chiefs.  They asked him to join their

    societies and later he became a chief.  He and his wife had one child,

    a body.  This little boy liked to stay with his grandfather, who told

    him stories.  His grandfather was Saritsaris (Mad Chief), a brave man of

    the Chaui Band.  The little boy cooled his grandfather''s mush or soup by

    swinging the dish back and forth, then he set it before the old man.

    When the little boy was about half-grown he heard that a war party was

    to start.  He told his mother that he wanted to go, and he wanted her

    and his grandmother to make him some moccasins.  He also wanted arrows,

    a bow and a quiver, and all the equipment of a warrior.  When the old

    man heard this he called the boy and said, "Do you realize what you are

    doing?"

    "Yes, I am grown to be a man."

    "Do you have dreams at night?"

    "Yes."

    "Can you relate some of them?"

    "Yes."

    "Tell one to me."

    "In my dream I was with a war party.  I found myself coming toward home

    through deep snow."

    "That is enough," said the old man.  "You can go."

    The women had sent the boy to his grandfather, thinking he would keep

    him at home, and they were greatly surprised to learn that the grandfather

    had told the boy to go with the warriors.  It was fall when the war party

    started.  As winter was coming near it was noised through the camp that

    all the war party had been killed and the people began to mourn.  The

    women of this family mourned exceedingly and cut their flesh with knives,

    but the old man sat and laughed at them, or smoked his pipe.  This went

    on for about 10 days.  Then his wife said, "You did not care for our

    grandchild," and his daughter said, "Why do you not mourn?"  The old man

    said to his wife, "You remember that you turned the boy over to me when

    he wanted to go to war.  You made moccasins for him and filled his

    quiver with arrows.  I questioned him and found that he had a dream in

    which he was returning alone through deep snow.  That dream will come

    true.  He is coming home, so I want you all to stop mourning."

    They would not believe him, but one day, after a snow, some people

    going out from the village met the young man returning.  He said, "All

    the warriors were killed except myself."

    The man rode back and cried through the village, "Saritsaris'' grandchild

    is coming through the deep snow."

    Everyone in the lodge was excited, except the old man.  He did not rush

    out to meet his grandson.  The women urged him to go, but he said, "He

    is coming; never mind."

    When the young man entered the lodge his grandfather said, "Sit on my

    knees."  The old man passed his hands downward over the young man''s

    head and body in the tribal manner of "blessing," and said, "I believed

    in your dream and now you are here."

    Then he told him to sit yonder and said, "I ask you -- when attacked,

    did you hide in a ravine?  When you were a little boy and cooled my

    mush I told you that I never wanted to hear that your body was found

    in a ravine.  I said that if you must be killed, let it be on a hilltop,

    fighting in the open.  I told you not to run away.  Did you fight the

    enemy?  Is it possible that you had gone on an errand and on your

    return found the fight going on and ran home instead of joining your

    comrades?  I told you always to tell the truth.  Don''t lie to me now.

    Tell me the truth."

    The young man said, "This will tell the story," and he exposed his arm,

    which was raw and sore from wrist to elbow, where the bowstring had

    stung him.  The boy said, "I did not even throw away my buffalo robe.

    I fought until night and then they let me alone."

    The old man said, "Now your name shall be Sirirut Kawi, the same as

    your father''s.  If you had been killed I would not have shed a tear,

    for I urged you to go on the warpath."

    So the young man lived with his grandfather until the next summer,

    when the village was attacked by the enemy.  The young man went out

    and was killed.  The news was brought into the village and the old man

    heard it.  He took his robe of bear skin, threw it over his shoulder,

    and went about the camp telling how kind the young man was to the old

    and sick.  Returning home, he said, "You waved the bowl of mush to cool

    it.  I shall miss you."

    People said his heart was like stone until he sang this song.  Then he

    wept.  In the first portion of the words he sings about himself and

    his pride in his grandson, and in the latter portion he sings about the

    young man.'
