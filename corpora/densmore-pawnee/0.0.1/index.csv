A sacred bundle of the Skidi Pawnee was associated with Morning Star
and its ceremony was held in the early spring, having for its object the
securing of good crops in the coming season.  It was the writer's
privilege to see the Morning Star bundle in the house of the woman who
was its keeper, and also to see its contents exposed in the ceremony.
The bundle, in accordance with custom, was hung on the west wall of its
owner's house, and with it were hung four large gourds, symbolizing the
four deities who were the special guardians of Evening Star and also
representing the breasts of the two women in the west, Evening Star and
Moon.
The legend from which the Morning Star ceremony arose was related by
Coming Sun, whose grandfather was a high priest in the Morning Star village
and who received his name by inheritance from this ancestor.  With Coming
Sun's narrative is combined a limited number of details mention by Linton
in ""Sacrifice to the Morning Star by the Skidi Pawnee.""
As already stated, Morning Star ruled in the east and Evening Star in
the west.  All the stars west of the Milky Way were feminine and those to
the east were masculine, but the most powerful were Morning Star and
Evening Star.  Sun was with the former and Moon was a companion of the
latter.  One after another the eastern star came to court the stars in the
west, in order that man might be placed on the earth.  Moon welcomed them
and walked with them toward the west, but as soon as they came in sight of
the village she caused the ground to open so the man fell through and was
killed.  At last Morning Star resolved to go and woo the great Evening Star,
taking his little brother along to carry his pack.  Thus, according to
Coming Sun, a small star always appears near and slightly below the
morning star in the spring, representing the little brother.  Linton,
however, states that Morning Star was accompanied by Sun, who carried a
sacred bundle with a war club.
Ten obstacles were encountered by Morning Star and his companion, the
first five being difficulties of travel, such as sharp flints and sword
grass beneath their feet, and the last five being animals which attached
them, including the mountain lion, wildcat, buffalo, and bear.  All these
were placed in their way by Moon, who thought she could conquer them as
she had conquered the others.  But Morning Star carried a ball encased in
such a manner that when he threw it the casing broke and it became a ball
of fire.  When throwing the ball he sang the following song, which was
said to be one of the principal songs in the ceremony.  Linton states that
Morning Star struck the ground with his war club, closing the cracks made
by Moon for his destruction, and that he sang a song with substantially the
same words recorded by Coming Sun.
The tenth obstacle was not encountered by Morning Star until after he
entered the lodge of Evening Star.  The obstacle was a snake, but he
overcame it, as he had overcome the others, by means of the ball of fire
and the song.
Even Star saw that his power was greater than heres, but she determined
to hold him aloof as long as possible.  Finally, she insisted that he make
provision for the child that should be born; she even required him to
provide perfumed water for bathing the child and a cradle board in which
it should be placed.  On the hoop, or arch, of this cradle board was
painted a morning star and the lightnings, this custom being followed by
the Pawnee at the present time.  Evening Star also required him to plant a
tree in front of the lodge so that the mocking birds might nest there and
sing to the child.  From this union a daughter was born.  She cam down to
earth and wandered about in fear.  As she was running hither and thither she
met a boy, the child of Sun and Moon, and these two became the ancestors of
the human race.
Morning Star made a bundle and placed in it various articles connected
with the obstacles he had overcome on his westward journey.  He left this
bundle with Evening Star and for that reason a woman has always been the
keeper of the sacred bundle.  Other articles have been added from time to
time and will be noted in this paper.
It is said that Evening Star required a human sacrifice as her reward.
This sacrifice must be a pure and beautiful maiden and she demanded that
the sacrifice be repeated annually.  Long ago, Morning Star sometimes
appeared to a man in a dream and told him to secure a maiden for this
sacrifice.  According to Linton, a man who had this vision went to the
keeper of the Morning Star bundle and received the warrior's costume and
the sacred objects kept for such an expedition.  Other warriors joined him
and, preliminary to the expedition, they enacted the journey of the
Morning Star, and sang the song with which he overcame the obstacles placed
in his way. (Cf. Song No. 1)  When the ceremony ended it was almost time
for the Morning Star to rise and the leader went outside the lodge and
addressed an invocation to him.  After dancing furiously around their fire
and offering a last prayer to Morning Star the warriors started forth and
captured a maiden from the enemy.  Returning, they gave her into the care
of the chief of the Morning Star village until the time for her sacrifice.
She was treated in a ceremonial manner but kept in ignorance of her fate.
At the appointed time her body was painted, half red and half black, and
she was tied to a scaffold and shot through the heart with an arrow.  It
was said that the braided thong used to bind the girl to the scaffold is
now in the Morning Star bundle.
Tradition states that on one occasion the intended victim was rescued.
On the night preceding her execution she was seated beside some tall
sunflowers.  A young chief came through the tall weed and stole her away,
putting her on his horse and taking her to Fort Leavenworth, whence she
was returned to her own people.  She died within three months, having
been anointed for death with the sacred ointment of red paint and buffalo
fat.  This occurred about the year 1818.  The man who rescued the intended
victim was a warrior of distinction and through his influence the custom
was discontinued.  The ritual of the sacrifice is still rendered but no
actual sacrifice has taken place since that date.
Coming Sun, who sings the ceremonial songs, said that sometimes, during
the Morning Star ceremony he stops and says ""Listen,"" and the people hear
a woman's voice singing the songs above his head.
The Morning Star ceremony was held by the Skidi Band near Pawnee,
Okla., on April 17, 1920.  This ceremony formerly lasted four days and
nights, ending when the morning star appeared in the east, but at the
present time it is concluded in one day.  On this occasion the writer
had the honor of entering the lodge, through the courtesy of Coming Sun.
It is said that one other white person, Dr. G. A. Dorsey, has entered the
lodge during the ceremony and seen the contents of the sacred bundle.
The ceremony was held in a tipi erected for the occasion in a quiet
spot near the house of the keeper of the bundle, north of Pawnee.  This
tipi has been used in the Ghost dance and was decorated with Ghost dance
symbols.  The adjacent landscape is shown in Plate 3,c.  The ceremony
began at about 9 a.m. and continued until 4 p.m., the writer sitting
outside the tipi except for the brief time she was permitted to enter.
Thus the entire songs of the ceremony were heard, as well as the prayers
and rituals, though only the principal song was obtained.  At the proper
time Coming Sun, who was in charge of the ceremony, sent a message to
summon the writer and she entered the lodge, passing to the right and
standing near the bundle before which she laid gifts of calico, tobacco,
and money.  Coming Sun was seated back of the bundle, directly opposite
the entrance, and held one of the sacred gourd rattles.  Two men at either
side of him held similar rattles.  In front of the men at Coming Sun's
left and next [to] the sacred bundle was a belt decorated

Chaui Band of Pawnee and is in charge of Mr. Stacy Matlock, a prominent
member of that band.  The closing events of the ceremony are the Buffalo
and Lance dances, which were witnessed by the writer through the courtesy
of Mr. Matlock, no other white person being present.  The ceremony and
dances were held in a large earth lodge, several miles south of the town
of Pawnee.  The opening of the lodge was toward the east.  At some
distance was a framework, probably that of a sweat lodge.  Only members
of the Buffalo Society were admitted to the painting of the skull, but
during the Buffalo dance the skull painted a few days previously, lay on
a folded blanket in front of the ""altar"" which was opposite the entrance.
This occasion and the Lance dance held a few days later afforded exceptional
opportunities to listen to Pawnee songs, but the semidarkness of the lodge
and the solemnity of the occasion precluded the taking of notes upon either
the music or the details of the ceremonial dances.
The chief singer at both of these dances was Wicita Blain, a blind man
who received the songs by inheritance.  He led the songs which were sung
at a certain position back of the altar.  At a later time he recorded the
ceremonial songs here presented, also certain songs of the Bear dance,
which is held in equally high esteem by the Pawnee.  John Luwak, chief of
the Chaui Band, was prominent at the Lance dance and later recorded 
numerous songs, including those of the Crow Lance Society.
The following song was led by Mr. Blain at the Buffalo dance attended
by the writer and is a very old song concerning Mrs. Blain's uncle, whose
name was Naru'dapadi.  A great herd of buffalo came to the place where
the Indians were encamped and threatened the destruction of the village.
Her uncle rode toward them, shouting and firing his gun in an attempt to
divert them from their course, but he was caught in the herd.  There were
buffalo on all sides of him as the herd swept through the camp and across
a stream, carrying him with them.",,"['Listen, he said,', 'Now it (the man) sits among them (the buffalo),', 'These are his sayings,', 'Now it sits among them as they come,', 'Now they have passed through the village,', 'Now they have crossed the stream,', 'It flies above them here and there, shouting and calling.']"

that it was a painful thing to live to be so old.

It was further stated that ""sometimes when men were
having this dance an enemy attacked the village.

age and, as he had no children, he gave the dance to a
young man who was one of his nearest relatives.
One day the people said, ""Some Indians are coming to
attack us.""
The young man who had received the dance took his raven
lance, mounted his pony, and went to get the old man.
They rode together on the pony to a place near the
fight and then went forward on foot, but the old man
could not go as fast as the warriors.  The old man
called, ""I am still coming,"" and the young man came
back and helped him forward.
The aged man was proud to see that the young man to
whom he had given his dance was among the leaders in
the fight.  The enemy shot and killed the young man,
and the lance was brought back with his body.  Then
the old man sang this song.  In the manner of recording
the song there was a wailing which was said to be
""the old man crying because the young man had been
killed and he had no more relatives,"" yet he loved the
lance and all that it symbolized.  He died soon afterwards
and, as he was too old to give the dance to anyone else,
the Pawnee do not have the dance at the present time.",,"['(An exclamation of endearment)', 'Beloved emblem, they are carrying it forward,', 'Beloved emblem, they are bringing it back.']"

worked for white people, from whom they obtained whisky.  This class
of Pawnee sang what were termed ""crazy people's songs,"" which were
associated with ""love charms"" and evil influences.  No effort was
made to secure examples of these songs.  A change from the former

They were good-looking
lads and wore their hair long on the right side of the head.  One day
the younger boy thought he would go to another village in the woods.
When he came near this village he saw the smoke of a tipi that stood
by itself among the willows.  He went there and stood outside the entrance.
In this tipi lived an old woman and her three granddaughters.  The old
woman told the youngest girl to go outside and see if anyone was there.
the girl saw the strange lad and returned, saying ""O grandmother, there
is a good-looking young man outside.""  The old woman wanted to speak with
him and said, 'You had better go to some village where the people have money.
We are very poor.""  But the lad replied, ""No. I cam here and this is where
I belong.""  The old woman said, ""Well, come in,"" and the boy entered the
tipi.  Later the old woman said, ""You had better go away for the chief of
our band is very unkind to strangers.  You must watch, for Longnose (Coyote)
will come before daylight to see if anyone is here.  He will see you and
tell the chief, who will ask you to breakfast.  If he offers you dry
pumpkin do not eat it, nor corn, nor mush.  Bring it home with you.""
Before daylight, as the old woman had predicted, Coyote came to see if
anyone was in the tipi.  The old woman said, ""See my grandson, how
good-looking he is.  He ought to go where the big men are.""  Coyote ran
at once to the chief and said, ""O chief, there is a good looking young
man down at the old woman's tipi.  When you kill him he will be the leader
of your heads.""  (Referring to a row of the heads of men killed by the
chief that had been put in his tipi.)  The chief said, ""Run down to the old
woman's tipi and bring the young man.  I want to feast him.""  Coyote ran
as fast as he could.  The old woman saw him coming and again told the
young man not to eat anything but to bring the food home.  Coyote said to
the young man, ""You certainly are good-looking.""  When the chief saw the
young man he said, ""I sent for you to eat with me,"" and offered him dry
pumpkin, corn, much, and other food.  The lad replied, ""O grandfather, I
am full; I have had my breakfast; I will take this home to my grandmother.""
Coyote went with him and waited while the old woman emptied and washed
the bowls.  Then Coyote took the bowls back to the chief.  After the boy
refused to eat the food, the chief wanted him to play the ""stick game.""
He refused at first but finally he said that he would play in two days,
saying he must wait because he was so tired.  The chief said, ""Choose a
day and we will play.""  The boy went home and told the old woman that he
was to play the stick game with the chief.  She said, ""O my boy, you did
wrong to consent.  You saw those heads in the chief's tent.  He will kill
you and all our people.""
Before daylight on the day of the game Coyote opened the old woman's door
and said, ""The chief is at the place for the game, he is waiting for you.""
The boy replied, ""I will go when I am ready.""  Later they began to play
the stick game.  The boy had people on his side and also a bird-man
(bird turned into a man), who watched everything.  Coyote watched
everything on the chief's side.  the boy had nothing to wager so he bet
the people who were on his side, and at last he was obliged to bet himself.
The old chief won, so the people on the chief's side killed all the people
on the boy's side.  They even killed the boy.  Then they cut off all the
heads and put them up with the other heads in the chief's lodge.
While this was happening the elder of the two boys, mentioned at the
beginning of this story, grew uneasy about his brother.  He determined
to find him and traced him to the village, then he went home, got his
bow and arrows, and went to the old woman's tipi.  The old woman did
as before, sending the same girl to see if anyone were outside.  The
girl returned and said, ""It looks as though that good-looking boy had
come to life.""  The old woman invited him into the tend but said as
before, ""O my grandson, why do you come here.  You ought to go where
the rich people are.""  He replied as his brother had done, ""No, I want
to be here.""  They were so poor that they gave him only one bean from
those they had gathered.  At night the old woman said as before, ""O my
grandson, I wish you would go away.  Go somewhere else or go home, for
someone will come early in the morning to look all around the place.""
Everything happened exactly as before.  Coyote came, found the young
man, and took him to the chief, who offered him food.  The young man
replied, as his brother had done, that he was not hungry, and he took the
food home.  The chief asked him to play the stick game and he said that
he was too tired to play that day.  It was decided that they would play in
a few days.  The boy went home and said to his grandmother, ""I am going to
play the stick game with the chief.  To-morrow I want you to clean up the
house and put everything one side, then I want you all to go into the woods.
Do not try to look into the house until I call you.""  Then he asked, ""Is
there any place around here where the people used to kill buffalo?""
She replied, ""Yes, over there by the hill.""
After they had gone the young man took the pipe out of the sacred bundle
that the old woman kept.  Before daylight he filled the pipe and went toward
the place where they used to kill the buffalo.  When he reached the place
he found many buffalo bones.  He held the stem of the pipe down toward the
buffalo bones and sang the following song.",,"['Father, I have brought this pipe for you to smoke.', 'I am lonely for my brother.']"

came toward him and said, ""I will be the first to help you.  We know about
the wicked chief and what he has been doing.""  The buffalo threw himself down
down and when he got up he shook himself.  Where he had been lying the boy
saw a game stick.  The buffalo said, ""Take this stick.""  A young buffalo
did the same and gave the boy another stick.  Then a young buffalo cow did
the same and when she arose the boy saw a game ring which she told him
to use.  The boy brought the two sticks and the ring home with him and
hung them beside the sacred bundle.  On the day of the game he told his
grandmother that he would send someone for the sticks and the ring but
did not want anyone to be at home when the messenger came.
In the morning Coyote came as before and said that all was ready for the
game.  Everything was the same as when the younger man played, the chief
having Coyote and the man having the bird-man on his side.  They began
to play and the chief won as before.  The boy had no goods so he bet the
people, as his brother had done.  The chief said, ""Now you have bet all
the people, you ought to bet yourself.""  The young man said ""All right.""
Then his stick struck the chief's stick and broke it in two.  The young
man said, ""Thanks.  Now I will not be killed.""  The chief said, ""Perhaps
you have some gaming sticks somewhere.""  The man said, ""Yes,"" and sent
Coyote to get them, adding, ""They are common sticks, lying on the floor.""
Coyote went to the old woman's lodge, opened the door and heard a noise
as of many buffalo.  He was frightened and ran back.  The chief sent
another messenger, who brought the same report.  Then the boy sent the
bird-man, who brought the sticks and the ring.  They did not make any
noise when he entered the lodge for they knew he was the right person.
The boy played with the sticks and had good luck.  He won back all the
people, and the chief's leg was broken.  Then the boy sang this song.
They played again and the chief said, ""Throw the sticks toward the east.""
They threw the sticks toward the east and the boy's stick went through
the hoop and went on and on, and finally it turned into a buffalo.  As
soon as the chief's people saw the stick turn into a buffalo they began
to cry, but the boy's people began to rejoice.
The young man asked, ""Where is my brother's head?""  They told him.
He asked, ""Where are his bones?""  They told him this also.  Then he
laid his brother's bones in order on the ground, with the head at one end.
Then he stood below his brother's foot and kicked the foot, saying,
""Why are you sleeping so long?""  His brother arose and said, ""Yes, I have
been asleep a long time,"" and smoothed his hair.

Related by Mrs. Mary Murie.
The narrator of [this] story said that it did not originate with the
Pawnee and she thought that it came from the Omaha in Nebraska.
There was a man so jealous of his wife that he determined to take her
away from the village.  He told her to pack everything and they would go.
They took plenty of dried meat, pounded meat, corn, and all kinds of food,
and left the village.  When night came they camped.  They were far from
any people and her husband said they would stay in that place.  He was a
good hunter and killed deer, turkeys, and other game.  After a while they
made an earth lodge to live in.  Every morning the man put plenty of meat
beside the fire, brought some water, and told his wife to stay in the lodge
until his return.  He was gone until night.
In time his wife bore a child and named it Nuri.  Indeed she bore twin
boys, but her husband did not notice the second child and buried it with
the afterbirth.  The second child crawled out of the ground and lived
with the animals, but his mother never knew.  Her husband told her, as
before, that she must stay in the lodge.  He said that he had seen some
bad people prowling about.  One day, when the man was away, these bad
people cam to the lodge.  His wife was sitting beside the fire and the
baby was asleep when she heard a sound and looked toward the door.  Even
men entered the lodge and said, ""Give us something to eat.  We know that
you have plenty of food.""  She did not reply but pointed to the meat that
was cooking on sticks around the fire.  They ate it all and went away.
After they had gone she exclaimed, ""Those horrid men ate all my meat.""
One heard it and said to the others, ""She called us names.""  So they all
went into the lodge and killed her.  They did not see the baby but they
carried the woman's body to their camp and devoured it.  When the man
came home he looked for his wife, and seeing the tracks he knew the wicked
people had taken her.  The man grieved greatly for his wife.
By this time the baby was old enough to walk and walk.  Every morning
before the man went to hunt he fixed the meat ready to cook and told the
little boy to play inside the lodge.  One day he went away as usual, after
fixing the meat, and the little boy thought, ""I will go outside.  I never
have seen what it is like out there.""  He went out and saw a little boy
coming toward him.  The boy was about his own size and was singing the
following song.  [story continued in next song]",,

The strange boy (who was his brother) said, ""Nuri, you are having a
good time with your father but I am here with my grandmothers, the wood
rates.  Your father is my father too.  I have plenty of wild grapes and
cherries but I do not have any meat to eat.""  Nuri said, ""Come into the
lodge and I will give you some.""  The strange boy sniffed the air and
asked, ""Is your father here?""  ""No,"" said Nuri.  The strange boy went into
the lodge and played until it was time for their father to return.  Then
he ran away, saying, ""Forget, forget,"" so that Nuri would not tell their
father.  This child was a ""wonder boy"" and he came every day until both
boys were quite grown.  One day he failed to say ""Forget"" when he went
away.  As the boy and his father were eating their supper Nuri said,
""Father, I want to tell you something.  There is a little boy who comes
every day to play with me while you are away.""  The man said to himself,
""I will try to catch the boy.""  So one morning he hid instead of going
away.  The wonder boy came as usual, singing the same little song.  He
stopped and sniffed the air, saying to Nuri, ""Your father is here.""  ""No,""
said Nuri, ""Perhaps you smell his blanket.""  ""It is certainly he,"" said the
boy, and ran away.  The father determined to catch the boy by a trick and
told Nuri how to tie a thong around his brother's scalplock.  In the
struggle that ensued the wonder-boy's scalplock was torn from his head
and held by the thong.  The father kept the scalplock gave the boys a good
supper, and told them to stay in the lodge.
Nuri obeyed his father, but as time passed, his brother continually
tried to lead him into danger.  When Nuri objected his brother would say,
""Give me my hair and I will go back to my grandmothers.""  Then Nuri would
yield, but the boys always returned in safety.  One day they brought
snake rattles and hung them on the door of the lodge.  Another day they
went to a place where a boat was moored.  If anyone went in his boat it
upset, threw the people into the water, and then returned to its place by
the shore.  The wonder boy wanted to go in the boat but Nuri objected.
The boy said as before, ""Then you must give me my hair and I will go back
to my grandmothers.""  Nuri yielded and they went in the boat, which soon
began tipping endwise and sidewise.  ""Do as I do,"" cried the wonder-boy,
moving his arms and making a noise like a wild goose.  Nuri imitated him
and the boys flew away.  Before leaving the boat they sand the following
song.
After they flew away the boat returned to the landing.
Then the wonder boy wanted to go where the people lived who killed his
mother.  These people lived in straw huts and when they saw the boys they
said, ""These boys are fat; we will have a good feast.""  The wonder boy
heard them talking.  They called to the boys and said, ""Come in soon, we
will have the feast ready,"" and aside they said, ""The boys have no sense.""
Nuri was afraid but his brother said, ""Do not cry.  We will destroy them.
If we do not they will kill us.""  The boys went into the lodge and saw a
kettle full of boiling water.  The wonder boy said, ""Do as I do.""  Then
both boys jumped on the edge of the kettle and upset it.  The boiling
water fell on the people but the boys flew out of the lodge like burned
leaves.  The people fought and killed one another, thinking they were
killing the boys, and the lodge burned up.  These people had long sharp
bones at the points of their elbows and heels and on the back of their
heads.  When they were dead the boys took off three or four of these
points.  The wonder boy said, ""Let us take these home for farther to use
in sewing moccasins.""
This frightened the father and that night he made up his mind to run
away and leave the boys.  The wonder boy knew that his father would do
this but Nuri cried the next morning, when his father had gone.  The
brother said, ""Father has left us but we will search until we find him.""
So the boys started to find their father.  At first they saw no trace,
and whenever they met a snake, a bear, or even a little but the wonder
boy would ask, ""Have you seen my father?""  They replied ""No.""  After the
boys had traveled a long time the brother said to Nuri, ""Are you tired?""
Nuri said that he was tired, and his brother summoned a tiger (mountain
lion?) and both boys rode on his back.  When they had traveled a long way
farther they came to a village and asked, ""Have you seen our father?""  The
people replied, ""Yes, we saw him going north.""  The boys traveled all
that night but could not find him.  The brother said, ""Let us kill all the
people in every village.""  Nuri cried, but yielded.  The wonder boy said,
""Nur, do this.""  The boys turned their heads from side to side and they
rattled.  They said to the people, ""If you see us you will die, and if
you do not see us you will die.""  The people fell over and died, one after
another.  Then the boys looked all through the village but could not find
their father.  At the third village they found that their father had been
killed by the people.  Huri cried but his brother said, ""I would not cry.
He left us to starve.""  They found their father's body and took it away
to a high hill.  They cut two willow poles, two cottonwood, two elm, and
two walnut poles, and four cedar posts about as long as the height of a
man.  They worked all day doing this, and took them on the hill.  Then
they laid them crosswise in a pile with sweet grass underneath and put
their father's body on top of the pile.  The wonder boy said, ""Father,
we used to love you but now we are going to burn you up and the smoke
will ascend to Tirawa; but, father, you are not dead forever, and some
day we will see you again.""",,"['Nuri, do this and we will turn into geese.', 'We will not drown.']"

This story differs from the preceding in that the entire narrative was
sung, a typical portion of the melody begin transcribed.  The story was
as follows:  In the place where the rattlesnakes lived there was a little
rattlesnake who cried because he wanted his rattle to make a noise.  He
said to his father, ""I do not see why I don't rattle.  I am just like my
brothers and sisters but their rattles rattle while mine does not.""  His
father said, ""You are not old enough.  When you are as big as your
brothers and sisters your rattle will rattle like theirs.""
The little snake cried so hard that at last they ""made medicine"" for
him so that his rattle would rattle.  Then he wanted to rattle it all
the time.
The little snake said to his father, ""Tell me how a chief's daughter
looks.  I want to bite her foot.""  His father said, ""A chief's daughter 
is very neat in her dress.  Those who are not the daughters of chiefs are
very careless  You can tell the difference in that way.""
The snakes' house was located on a road along which the Pawnee used
to travel.  The oldest snake said, ""Father, my little brother rattles all
the time.  The Pawnee will hear him and kill us all.  Make him stop.""
But the little snake kept on.  He even went beside the road and rattled
his rattle very loud.
One day a girl came along the road and the little snake thought she
was the chief's daughter.  He bit her foot and she turned quickly and
crushed his head.  The other snakes found him and the brother said,
""Father, didn't I tell you that one of us would be killed?  There is my
little brother with his head smashed.""  That is the end of the story.",,

The man said to his wife, ""Did you notice that young man?""

is handsome, he comes of a good family, he has plenty of horses and
his arms are strong so that he would be good to support us.""  When he
came the third time they told him to wait for his answer until the girl's

together, the mother's relatives being seated on the south and the

the decision to the mother's relatives, who decided that the girl should
be allowed to marry the young man.  Many presents were distributed.

horse to the father and mother of the girl.  The next day the old man
gave the horse to his wife.  There were buffalo robes and many valuable
articles among the presents.
All went well for a time, and then the young man began to beat his wife
and abuse her.  The girl's mother begged her father to interfere, but
he refused to do so.  She said, ""You claim to be a brave man; why do
you not make our son-in-law stop beating his wife?""
He said, ""Do you remember one beautiful morning when you said the
young man was handsome, that he came of good family, had many horses,
and his arms were strong?""
""Yes.""
""Do you remember that my relatives sat on the north and yours on the
south side of the lodge, and that my relatives left the decision to
yours?""
""Yes.""
""So your people sold our daughter to that man.  We have no right to
interfere with his property.  He gave the ponies.  He gave a fine pony
to us.  Didn't I give you that pony?""
""Yes.""
""Get a kettle.  Put it on the fire and put water in it.""  She did so.
""Now take your parfleche bag and put the finest of your dried meat in
the pot.  When the soup is done you must bring me some in a wooden bowl.""
When she brought the soup he told her to sit beside him and eat.  As
they ate he said, ""What nice fat!  What fine meat this is!  Who got it
for you?""
""Our son-in-law.""
""You like the meat that our son-in-law brings us?  He punishes our
daughter for her own good.  He does not want her to run around the camp
foolishly.  He wants her to be a good cook and to look after things in
the lodge.""
Then the woman stopped finding fault with her son-in-law.
The young man was well liked by the chiefs.  They asked him to join their
societies and later he became a chief.  He and his wife had one child,
a body.  This little boy liked to stay with his grandfather, who told
him stories.  His grandfather was Saritsaris (Mad Chief), a brave man of
the Chaui Band.  The little boy cooled his grandfather's mush or soup by
swinging the dish back and forth, then he set it before the old man.
When the little boy was about half-grown he heard that a war party was
to start.  He told his mother that he wanted to go, and he wanted her
and his grandmother to make him some moccasins.  He also wanted arrows,
a bow and a quiver, and all the equipment of a warrior.  When the old
man heard this he called the boy and said, ""Do you realize what you are
doing?""
""Yes, I am grown to be a man.""
""Do you have dreams at night?""
""Yes.""
""Can you relate some of them?""
""Yes.""
""Tell one to me.""
""In my dream I was with a war party.  I found myself coming toward home
through deep snow.""
""That is enough,"" said the old man.  ""You can go.""
The women had sent the boy to his grandfather, thinking he would keep
him at home, and they were greatly surprised to learn that the grandfather
had told the boy to go with the warriors.  It was fall when the war party
started.  As winter was coming near it was noised through the camp that
all the war party had been killed and the people began to mourn.  The
women of this family mourned exceedingly and cut their flesh with knives,
but the old man sat and laughed at them, or smoked his pipe.  This went
on for about 10 days.  Then his wife said, ""You did not care for our
grandchild,"" and his daughter said, ""Why do you not mourn?""  The old man
said to his wife, ""You remember that you turned the boy over to me when
he wanted to go to war.  You made moccasins for him and filled his
quiver with arrows.  I questioned him and found that he had a dream in
which he was returning alone through deep snow.  That dream will come
true.  He is coming home, so I want you all to stop mourning.""
They would not believe him, but one day, after a snow, some people
going out from the village met the young man returning.  He said, ""All
the warriors were killed except myself.""
The man rode back and cried through the village, ""Saritsaris' grandchild
is coming through the deep snow.""
Everyone in the lodge was excited, except the old man.  He did not rush
out to meet his grandson.  The women urged him to go, but he said, ""He
is coming; never mind.""
When the young man entered the lodge his grandfather said, ""Sit on my
knees.""  The old man passed his hands downward over the young man's
head and body in the tribal manner of ""blessing,"" and said, ""I believed
in your dream and now you are here.""
Then he told him to sit yonder and said, ""I ask you -- when attacked,
did you hide in a ravine?  When you were a little boy and cooled my
mush I told you that I never wanted to hear that your body was found
in a ravine.  I said that if you must be killed, let it be on a hilltop,
fighting in the open.  I told you not to run away.  Did you fight the
enemy?  Is it possible that you had gone on an errand and on your
return found the fight going on and ran home instead of joining your
comrades?  I told you always to tell the truth.  Don't lie to me now.
Tell me the truth.""
The young man said, ""This will tell the story,"" and he exposed his arm,
which was raw and sore from wrist to elbow, where the bowstring had
stung him.  The boy said, ""I did not even throw away my buffalo robe.
I fought until night and then they let me alone.""
The old man said, ""Now your name shall be Sirirut Kawi, the same as
your father's.  If you had been killed I would not have shed a tear,
for I urged you to go on the warpath.""
So the young man lived with his grandfather until the next summer,
when the village was attacked by the enemy.  The young man went out
and was killed.  The news was brought into the village and the old man
heard it.  He took his robe of bear skin, threw it over his shoulder,
and went about the camp telling how kind the young man was to the old
and sick.  Returning home, he said, ""You waved the bowl of mush to cool
it.  I shall miss you.""
People said his heart was like stone until he sang this song.  Then he
wept.  In the first portion of the words he sings about himself and
his pride in his grandson, and in the latter portion he sings about the
young man.",,"['Mad Chief sings as he walks, his spirit is glad as he walks.', 'Pushed Forward is no longer among us, yet we seem to see him;', 'Yonder he comes.']"
