issues:
  - title: Wrong titles
    description: >
      The titles do not correspond to the titles used by Böhme.
      Instead, they are textual incipits as you can see on 
      [this online scan](https://archive.org/details/BoehmeVtLieder1895).
  - title: Missing page numbers
    description: >
      There are no page numbers in the source files. We do have song 
      numbers, which can be derived from the catalogue numbers. 
  - title: Bibliographic references in comments?
    description: >
      There are some pointers to the sources in the comments, 
      ideally one would somehow use those sources, or perhaps
      only the collection date?
  - title: Mixed meters
    description: >
      Sometimes mixed meters are indicated in the comments. Is
      it useful to add this?
  - title: Genres correct?
    description: >
      Are the genres indeed correct? All of them have genre 
      `romance`?
