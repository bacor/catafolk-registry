- Densmore discusses 5 contour classes (Aâ€“E) based on contour plots of accented
notes. The contour classification for different songs is discussed in sections 
titled 'Plots of songs of ...', and we annotated these classifications in the 
column. `contour_classes`. 
- Some songs are described as having characteristics of multiple classes. 
All thoses classes are in that case annotated, e.g. `C,D`.
- Sometimes a song is said to resemble a class, while deviating from it in an 
important way. Songs in class A for example have no ascending intervals, but
some songs only have one ascending interval. Such resemblances are annotated
as `A'` rather than `A`.
- The field `tonality` contains the key as coded by Densmore. She identified
a key note (a tonal center), and assigned it a major or minor key based on the
presence of a major/minor third. Of course this classification may not be very
meaningful in this music.
