  - title: Languages
    description: >
      All songs are assigned language 'Sioux' (siou1253). Most are
      more specifically in the Teton dialect of which I do not know
      the glottolog id. Some others (95, 96, 97, 189, 190, 234,
      235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240] are from the the Santee dialect
      (glottolog dako1259).
  - title: Instrumentation and tempi
    description: >
      It could be interesting to copy the tempi and instrumentation
      from the original publication. Many songs have drum 
      accompaniament, sometimes in a different tempo than the voice.
