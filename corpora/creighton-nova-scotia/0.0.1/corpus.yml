issues:
  - title: Language correct?
    description: >
      Added language English (Atlantic Provinces English). Is this 
      indeed correct?
  - title: Reference record AMD?
    description: >
      Some files have a reference record `AMD`. Not sure what this is,
      but the values indicate its either the scale or modality. Is
      this correct?
