- If there was no indication of the use of a drum (e.g. a drum tempo, or a drum trancription),
    the song is assumed to be monophonic.
- Meters were transcribed (mostly) in order of occurance (but every meter is included only once)
- Tempo transcriptions generally follow the tempo indication for the voice (sometimes a drum tempo is also indicated)
