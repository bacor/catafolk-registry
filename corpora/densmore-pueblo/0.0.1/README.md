Catafolk notes
--------------

- The dataset was called `densmore-pueblo` rather than `densmore-acoma` since the songs come from several Pueblos besides Acoma, and indeed the running header of the book is 'Pueblo Music'.
- The IDs are of the form `pueblo01, pueblo02, ...` for the same reason.


Notes on additional metadata
----------------------------

Additional metadata was collected from the original publication (Densmore 1957) by Bas Cornelissen in 2020. It is stored as a separate [CSV file](https://github.com/bacor/catafolk/blob/master/datasets/densmore-pueblo/additional-metadata.csv), see also this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gFRuzpDddndbcpFqsChV6A9r5Etn98HaeN1X3WxeRU/edit?usp=sharing)

- The first 16 acoma songs were recorded in Washington D.C. in 1928 by dr. M. W. Stirling and his assitant by Anthony Wilding (Densmore 1957, p. 4)
- The remaining Acoma songs 17–40 were recorded by Densmore (p. 20)
- The recording date is a little unclear. Densmore writes (p. 4) "The songs of Pueblo Indians here presented were recorded in 1928, 1930, and 1940". Presumabely, Densmore recorded the 24 Acoma songs in 1930 (p. 20); so all Isleta, Cochiti and Zuni songs have date 1930-1940.
- The Zuñi songs were recorded no later than 1940 (Densmore 1957, p. 96).
- The location of the respective Pueblo is used as the location of each song, even though Densmore reports that the recordings of some Acoma songs were made in Washinton (p. 4). The coordinates of all Pueblos were taken from Wikipedia ([Acoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoma_Pueblo), [Isleta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_of_Isleta), [Cochiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochiti,_New_Mexico), [Zuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_Pueblo,_New_Mexico))
