  - title: Unknown sources
    description: >
      The last songs in this collection have a different catalogue 
      number and indeed do not appear to be in Erk & Böhme volumes. 
      From `deut2243.krn` onwards, catalogue numbers are of the 
      form `L0035A`
  - title: Different titles
    description: >
      The titles are actually incipits. The Erk & Böhme volumes 
      use different titles, as you can see in the scans;
      [volume 1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.l0063460471),
      [volume 2](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4134294) and
      [volume 3](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064313123)
  - title: Collection dates
    description: >
      Erk dates are used as earliest and latest collection dates.
      Can this be narrowed down?
