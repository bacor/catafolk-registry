Other songs containing the same characteristics are Nos. 3, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 16 in the Bear dance songs, and a majority of the hand game songs, Nos. 94-102. This rhythmic and melodic peculiarity suggests a vocal expression scarcely developed to the point of composed song. We find in it a resem blance to the rhythmic vocalization which accompanies concerted labor among peoples low in the scale of culture. In a majority of the songs cited the principal interval is the minor (or nonmajor) third, which characterizes the most primitive vocal expression of uncivilized peoples. (See Bull. 53, p. 7.) This interval is prominent also in the early music of civilization. The tone material of this song comprises a fundamental (G), with its minor third and minor seventh—a tone material not previously noted by the writer. For convenience the song is analyzed as in the key of G minor, though it can scarcely be said to constitute a key in the accepted sense of that term.
The rhythm of the notched-stick rattle is simple and does not vary in the songs recorded with its accompaniment. The rubbing stick is thrust downward upon the notched stick, producing a sharp, rasping sound, and as it is brought upward, preparatory to the next stroke, there is a similar but less pronounced sound, the downward stroke occupying a period of time slightly longer than that required for returning the rubbing stick to its original position. The sound pro duced by the upward motion varied with individuals, those who used he rattle with special energy producing, of course, a louder sound with the upward motion of the rubbing stick. The song under analysis is the only recorded Bear dance song in which the rattle and voice are not synchronous at the beginning of each count. In this song the tempo of the rattle is slightly slower than that of the voice.",,

Concerning this characteristic among Chippewa songs, see Bulletin 45, page 142, and Bulletin 53, page 258; among the Sioux songs, see Bulletin 61, pages 184,337. This chord has been found in the music of the American Negro 18 and was noted by Prof. J. C. Fillmore in songs of the Nass River Indians living in British Columbia; also among the songs of the Dahomy collected by Prof. Fillmore at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1892.
In the songs analyzed by the present writer this chord appears in two forms: (1) In songs of minor tonality it constitutes the tonic chord with seventh added, and (2) in songs of major tonality it constitutes the submediant chord with the dominant of the key added as its highest tone. It will be noted that in the first form the tonic triad appears as the lower and in the second form as the upper portion of the chord. The second is the more frequent form, as shown by the fact that 11 Chippewa songs are characterized by this chord and only three are minor in tonality. (See song No. 30.) In the song under analysis the tonic triad (G sharp, B-D sharp) forms the framework of the melody, the seventh being less prominent and occurring only twice. The rhythmic unit is short and its repe titions comprise all the song except the closing measures. Four renditions were recorded and show no differences except that in one rendition the opening phrase, before the repeated portion, was omitted.

Comparing the transcriptions of the two rendi tions, we find in the second a more regular rhythm and also an ornamentation of the melody, as in the third measure.

The song contains no rhythmic unit, though several measures begin with a dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth note. A short connective phrase was sung between the renditions. (See No. 7.) For other songs containing rests see analysis of No. 8. Sixty- five per cent of the progressions are whole tones —a peculiarity noted in the analysis of No. 28.",,

It is of interest as showing the manner in which the Utes frequently break the ascent of an octave in repeating a song. This is contrasted with the customs of the Sioux and Chippewa, who fre quently make the direct ascent of an octave or a twelfth in repeating a song. Songs having a connective phrase are noted in the analysis of No. 7. This song is divided rhythmically into two parts, which are alike except for the fifth measure. It will be readily noted that no measure corresponding to this appears after the rhythmic units in the second portion of the song. Another slight difference is that the first part ends in 3-A and the second in 2-4 time.

(Cf. Nos. 39 and 78.) Six renditions were recorded in 1914, the renditions being uniform and connected without a break in the time. The transcrip tion is from the cylinder made in 1914. Five renditions of the same song were recorded in 1916, at which time the writer did not play, the first record, but ""hummed"" the transcription. The singer recog nized it and said he would like to make another record of it. This second cylinder was transcribed and the results compared. In this comparison it is found that all the renditions recorded in 1916 omit the fifth and sixth measures and the last measure of the song as transcribed. As these measures are repetitions, this would be of slight importance, but as it reduces the occurrences of these phrases from three to two the change suggests a tendency toward regularity and conventionality. The first group of renditions was in a tempo of quarter = 104, and the key of G minor: the second was faster (quarter =108) but in a lower key—the key of F sharp minor. The 5-4 division of certain measures was strictly maintained. The song contains the tones of the second five-toned scale and is melodic in structure. Considering the lack of variety in progressions the melody is inter esting and quite diversified. One-half the intervals are minor thirds, and of the other half all except one interval are major seconds, that interval being an ascending fourth.

Thus, in the first instance, the singer said this was a song which he sang in the war dance when he brought home a captive woman, and, in the second instance, he said it was a scalp dance song. The words were not taken in either rendition.
A comparison of the two cylinders shows the pitch of the rendi tions to be the same. Five repetitions of the song were recorded the first time and six the second time. The differences in these 11 renditions are too slight to be of importance. In the first group the opening phrase was occasionally repeated, and in the second group the ending was occasionally changed in rhythm, and the fifth measure (last two counts) contained quarter in place of eighth notes.

The fifth measure contains in its second count a division resembling that of the rhythmic unit but which was uniformly sung as two sixteenths instead of an eighth note. The only progressions are fourths and major seconds. In ascending progression there are seven fourths and three whole tones, and in descending progression there are eight fourths and three whole tones. Considering A to be the keynote of the melody, its tones are the key note, fourth, and fifth.
