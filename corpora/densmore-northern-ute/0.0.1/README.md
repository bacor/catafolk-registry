Notes on additional metadata
----------------------------

Additional metadata was collected from the original publication (Densmore 1922) by Bas Cornelissen in 2020. It is stored as a separate [CSV file](https://github.com/bacor/catafolk/blob/master/datasets/densmore-northern-ute/additional-metadata.csv), see also this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E9DcV8ajtnhnVkehvjamAsgl4Y9784f2YWo39Y9MWRM)

- The table with the names of the singers (p. 19) lists a singer (no 10) of
which there are no songs included in the book. The native name of singer 12
then refers to singer 10, so I've used that native name for singer 12. Not
quite sure if that's correct. On the next page, Densmore notes that 'Perank' is 
a mispronunciation of 'Frank'.
