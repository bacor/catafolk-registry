  description: This melody comprises six rhythmic periods, the first four containing
    two measures each and the last two containing three measures each. The final measure
    in every period contains two eighth notes followed by a quarter note. This phrase
    is sung on the lowest tone in the period which, with its frequent recurrence,
    gives the phrase a certain emphasis. Noting the tones on which this occurs we
    find them to be G, F, G, F, G, G. The tones in the first, third, fifth, and sixth
    periods are those of the triad of G minor, and the song is analyzed in that key.
    The melody progresses chiefly by thirds, 63 per cent of the intervals being minor
    and 22 per cent major thirds.

  description: "This song is characterized by a monotonous rhythm and a lack of variety\
    \ in melodic progression. Other songs containing the same characteristics are\
    \ Nos. 3, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 16 in the Bear dance songs, and a majority of the\
    \ hand game songs, Nos. 94-102. This rhythmic and melodic peculiarity suggests\
    \ a vocal expression scarcely developed to the point of composed song. We find\
    \ in it a resem blance to the rhythmic vocalization which accompanies concerted\
    \ labor among peoples low in the scale of culture. In a majority of the songs\
    \ cited the principal interval is the minor (or nonmajor) third, which characterizes\
    \ the most primitive vocal expression of uncivilized peoples. (See Bull. 53, p.\
    \ 7.) This interval is prominent also in the early music of civilization. The\
    \ tone material of this song comprises a fundamental (G), with its minor third\
    \ and minor seventh\u2014a tone material not previously noted by the writer. For\
    \ convenience the song is analyzed as in the key of G minor, though it can scarcely\
    \ be said to constitute a key in the accepted sense of that term.\r\nThe rhythm\
    \ of the notched-stick rattle is simple and does not vary in the songs recorded\
    \ with its accompaniment. The rubbing stick is thrust downward upon the notched\
    \ stick, producing a sharp, rasping sound, and as it is brought upward, preparatory\
    \ to the next stroke, there is a similar but less pronounced sound, the downward\
    \ stroke occupying a period of time slightly longer than that required for returning\
    \ the rubbing stick to its original position. The sound pro duced by the upward\
    \ motion varied with individuals, those who used he rattle with special energy\
    \ producing, of course, a louder sound with the upward motion of the rubbing stick.\
    \ The song under analysis is the only recorded Bear dance song in which the rattle\
    \ and voice are not synchronous at the beginning of each count. In this song the\
    \ tempo of the rattle is slightly slower than that of the voice."

  description: This song, in contrast to that next preceding, is char acterized by
    the interval of the major third, which constitutes 52 per cent of the intervals.
    Next in frequency is the interval of a fourth, constituting 27 per cent of the
    entire number. The rhythmic unit is short and occurs in both double and triple
    measures. Count- divisions similar to those in the rhythmic unit appear throughout
    the song. The melody tones are those of the major triad and fourth. The low G
    at the close of the song was given with distinctness, though it seemed to be below
    the natural compass of the singer's voice. No variation occurred in the four renditions
    of this melody. The interval of a fourth characterizes this song and is also prominent
    in Nos. 7, 11, 16, 20, 50, 88, 90, and 100. A monotonous rhythm somewhat resembling
    that of the present song is noted also in Nos. 4, 6, 10, 15, 16, 42, 98, and 101.
    This peculiarity was not found in songs of the Chippewa and Sioux.

  description: Two renditions of this song were recorded and are uniform in every
    respect. This is interesting, as the rhythmic unit is long and the measure-divisions
    monotonous. In numerous Ute songs there occurs a connective phrase, sung between
    renditions of the melody. In some instances a connective tone is sung midway of
    the ascent from the final tone of the song to that with which the repetition begins.
    In this instance the connective tone is on the same pitch as the lowest tone of
    the melody. A wide variety of intervals occurs in the song, a peculiarity which
    was noted in the more modern Sioux songs. Thus we find five sorts of ascending
    and four of descending intervals, while in the song next preceding, which was
    mistaken for an old song, almost 80 per cent of the intervals were fourths and
    major thirds. This song is melodic in structure and contains the tones of the
    fourth five-toned scale.

    measure near the close. The melody tones are those of the fourth five-toned scale,
    and the ascending and descending intervals are about equal in number. Major and
    minor thirds constitute 89 per cent of the intervals, though the fourth is prominent
    in a portion of the melody. Five renditions were recorded and show no variations.

  description: A peculiarity of this song is the rest during which, in the four renditions
    of the song, the voice was silent while the scraping of the rattle continued in
    exact tune. Two rhythmic units occur, and count-divisions similar to those of
    the units appear throughout the melody. About half the progressions are whole
    and half tones, which is unusual. The melody contains all the tones of the octave
    except the sixth and seventh. The descending intervals of a fourth were sung glissando
    in this as in numerous other songs of the Bear dance. This glissando was said
    to "imitate the sound made by a bear." Other songs containing rests are Nos. 11,
    19, 27, 41, 46, 48, 68, 77, 95, 96, and 97.

  description: The tone material of this song comprises a fundamental with its minor
    third, fourth, and minor seventh. Progression is chiefly by thirds, which constitute
    86 per cent of the intervals. The song contains four rhythmic periods and four
    closing measures. This form is accurately repeated in the three renditions of
    the song. Rattle and voice have the same tempo and were synchronous on the first
    of each count.

  description: All the tones of the octave occur hi this song, which is minor in tonality
    and melodic in structure. The opening tone is the seventh, followed by a descending
    fourth sung glissando. This is an unusual opening but is uniform in the four renditions
    of the song. About 65 per cent of the progressions are thirds, though the fourth
    is prominent in the first part of the song. The rhythmic unit is short and in
    itself uninteresting, but the triple measures give variety and character to the
    rhythm of the song as a whole. The tempo of the song is unusually slow.

  description: Four renditions of this song were recorded and in them all occur the
    changes of tempo indicated in the transcription. The first of the slower phrases
    is on a tone which appettrs to have little relation to the rest of the melody,
    but this tone was persistent in the several renditions. Two rhythmic units occur,
    having the same division of the first count bxit differing in the remaining portion.
    The fourth is a prominent interval, comprising 25 per cent of the entire number.
    (See No. 3.) Attention is directed to the ascent of a ninth, midway through the
    song. Reference to Table 12 on page 41 will show .this to be an unusual progression.
    The song is melodic in structure and contains the tones of the second five-toned
    scale. Other songs containing rests are noted in the analysis of No. 8. Other
    songs containing a change of tempo are Nos. 76 and 99.

  description: The rhythmic unit of this song occurs only twice, the second time being
    on a pitcli slightly lower than the first. Count- divisions similar to those of
    the unit occur throughout the song. Seven renditions were recorded with no variation
    except that the sixteenth note followed by an eighth note was not always clear
    in relative time value. The fourth is prominent in the structure of the melody,
    though almost half the progressions are whole tones. The song has a compass of
    nine tones and contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh

  description: This is a pleasing melody containing the tones of the fourth five-toned
    scale. Six renditions were recorded, the tune being continuous throughout the
    performance. The wide variety of intervals suggests that the song may be modern,
    since that peculiarity characterized Sioux songs which were known to be less than
    50 years old. This song contains five sorts of ascending and five of descending
    intervals. The glissando manner of singing was especially marked in this instance.

  description: In rhythm this song is typical of the monotonous type of Bear dance
    song which could be continued indefinitely. (See No. 2.) The two rhythmic units
    are alike except that in the second there is a concluding measure which gives
    balance to the rhythm of the song as a whole. With one exception the progressions
    are major and minor thirds. Several renditions were recorded and show no points
    of difference.

  description: The rhythm of this song is unusually interesting. It will be noted
    that the first and third rhythmic units have the same division of the second count
    and that the second and third units have the same division of the first count.
    The even triplet division of certain measures can not be considered a unit of
    rhythm, as a triplet occurs in the first measure of the first unit. This rhythmic
    structure does not vary in the several renditions of the song. Sixty-five pro
    gressions occur, the only intervals being the fourth and the major third. (See
    Nos. 3 and 17.) The song has a compass of six tones and contains only the tones
    of the major triad.

  description: This, like the song next preceding, is major in tonality, harmonic
    in structure, has a compass of six tones, and progresses only by intervals of
    the fourth and the major third. The present melody contains 15 progressions, 53
    per cent of which are downward, and the preceding melody contains 67 progressions,
    51 per cent of which are downward. With these melodic similarities it is interest
    ing to note the difference between the rhythmic character of the two songs. Only
    one rhythmic unit occurs in the song under analysis, its four repetitions comprising
    the entire melody. The preceding song contains three short rhythmic units with
    many intervening measures. The present song contains eight changes of measure
    lengths, while the preceding song is in 2-4 time throughout.

  description: Two rhythmic units occur in this song, the count-divi sions of the
    first being reversed in the second. The song comprises three rhythmic periods,
    the first two containing five measures each and the third containing four measures.
    All the tones of the octave occur in the song, which is minor in tonality and
    progresses chiefly by whole tones. Voice and drum have the same tempo and are
    synchronous on the first of each count.

  description: The transcription of this song is from the fourth rendition. An interesting
    variation in previous renditions is that measures 5, 9, and 14 are frequently
    changed from double to triple measures by a repetition of the first count. The
    rest midway throu h the song was given distinctly in all the renditions. For other
    songs containing rests see No. 8. With three exceptions the progressions are thirds
    and major seconds, yet the melody has a range of 13 tones. The song is major in
    tonality and contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh.

  description: A descending progression of a fourth constitutes almost 25 per cent
    of the intervals in this song. (See No. 3.) No rhythmic unit is present, although
    an eighth-note division is of frequent occur rence. The song is minor in tonality,
    melodic in structure, and lacks the second tone of the complete octave. The drumbeat
    was in quarter-note values, the strokes being of equal force.

  description: The rhythm of this song was accurately repeated in the three renditions
    except in the measure before the last, in which the note-values often were given
    as four eighth notes. The rhythmic form is irregular but coherent. Two rhythmic
    units occur, the first comprising one measure and the second nine measures. The
    song is minor in tonality, begins and ends on the dominant, and lacks the seventh
    and second tones of the complete octave. In structure it is melodic with harmonic
    framework, the tonic chord being strongly in evidence. Thirty-seven progressions
    occur, about two-thirds of which are descending intervals.

  description: This melody contains six sorts of ascending and six of descending intervals,
    which is an unusually wide variety. The tonic chord constitutes the framework
    of the melody, which contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh.
    Like several other Sun dance songs this begins on the dominant in the upper and
    ends on the dominant in the lower octave. The group of five sixteenth notes was
    sung with distinctness.

  description: This song resembles the preceding in that it contains two rhythmic
    units and all the tones of the octave. About 89 per cent of the progressions are
    whole tones and semitones. Other songs containing a large proportion of these
    intervals are Nos. 34, 36, 41, 44, 49, 52, 73, 82, 89, 98, and 108. The song has
    a compass of 12 tones. The steadily descending trend of the melody is shown in
    the melody plot (fig. 2). This song and the song next following were recorded
    without drum, as no drum was used with them in the dance.

  description: The only intervals in this song are fourths and thirds, the major and
    minor thirds each constituting about 40 per cent of the entire number. Ascending
    and descending intervals are more nearly equal than in a majority of the songs
    under analysis. The repetitions of the rhythmic unit comprise the entire song
    except the opening and closing measures. All the tones of the octave, except the
    fourth, occur in the song, which has a compass of 10 tones. No change of time
    occurs in this melody.

  description: "In this song the interrupted drumbeat, which characterizes the Turkey\
    \ dance songs, was given with sufficient clearness to permit its transcription\
    \ below the melody notes (cf. Nos. 31, 45). \r\nThe eighth-note values of the\
    \ drumbeats were maintained more steadily in the 5-8 and 7-8 measures than in\
    \ the 2-4 and 3-4 meas ures, and the drum was more synchronous with the voice\
    \ in the latter than in the first part of the song; thus the notation of the drum\
    \ should be understood as approximate rather than absolute. After singing the\
    \ song as transcribed the singer began at the first measure without a break in\
    \ the time, ending the performance with the ninth measure of the song. The third\
    \ and sixth measures in both renditions were sung as indicated, although the ninth\
    \ and eleventh measures from the close, containing the same progressions, were\
    \ sung in 3-4 time.\r\nObserving the formation of the melody, we note that it\
    \ is major in tonality and comprises the tones of the fourth five-toned scale\
    \ with B as keynote, yet the structure of the melody is chiefly that of the minor\
    \ triad and seventh. (See analysis of No. 38.) The song has a compass of 11 tones,\
    \ yet 87 per cent of the progressions contain two or three semitones."

  description: This song resembles the preceding song in melodic structure, though
    differing widely from it in rhythm. Eighty-four per cent of the progressions contain
    two or three semitones, yet the song has a compass of 10 tones. Ascending and
    descending pro gressions are singularly uniform, there being in ascending progression
    1 fourth, 3 minor thirds, and 3 major seconds, while the descending progressions
    comprise 2 fourths, 5 major thirds, and 5 major seconds. The tone material is
    that of the second five-toned scale. The inter rupted drumbeat, noted in the preceding
    song, is present in this phonograph record but is not transcribed.

  description: The downward trend of this song, following the inter vals of the tonic
    chord, is emphasized by a glissando of the voice, indicated in the transcription.
    The melody contains only the tones of the major triad and second. It has a compass
    of 11 tones and a majority of the progressions are minor thirds. No ascending
    pro gressions occur between accented tones. (See plot, fig. 4.) Repe titions of
    the rhythmic unit comprise the entire melody except the closing measures.

  description: The progressions of this melody suggest E flat as a keynote, but G
    (the third) is not present and the melody is not classified in tonality or key.
    Another song of the present series lacking the third is No. 37. (See Bull. 53,
    p. 140, and Bull. 61, p. 135.) The interval of a fourth constitutes 22 per cent
    of the progressions, the remaining intervals, with one exception, being major
    and minor thirds. Two rhythmic periods comprise the entire song, a short rhythmic
    unit occurring in both periods. The drum is slightly faster than the voice and
    steadily maintained in the five renditions.

  description: 'In melodic structure this song comprises three parts: The first (3
    measures) is based on the major triad B-D sharp-F sharp; the second (1 measure)
    on the minor triad G sharp-B-D sharp; and the third (4 measures) on the chord
    B-D.sharp-F sharp-B, the accented tones following the descending intervals of
    this chord. The song is thus seen to be strongly harmonic in character. No interval
    larger than a minor third occurs in the song, and about 58 per cent of the progressions
    are whole tones. (See No. 28.) The song has a compass of 13 tones and contains
    the entire octave except the seventh. Repetitions of the rhythmic unit comprise
    practically the entire song.'

  description: The rhythmic structure of this song is interesting. Two rhythmic units
    occur, the first containing three and the second two counts. After a repetition
    of the first rhythmic unit we note a measure suggesting the second unit, followed
    by a measure resem bling the first unit, this, in turn, followed by the second
    unit and its repetition. The first unit reappears and is followed by a measure
    bearing resemblances to both units, the song closing with three repetitions of
    the second unit. This intelligent use of thematic material indicates a degree
    of musical cultivation among the Utes. The melody has a compass of an octave and
    contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh. Whole tones comprise
    84 per cent of the progressions. (See No. 28.)

  description: "This song contains the tones B flat, E flat, G natural, and A natural,\
    \ suggesting the key of B flat major, yet the third of that key does not appear.\
    \ (See No. 33.) The song begins with an ascending octave. Only one other Ute song\
    \ has this initial interval (No. 91). Chippewa and Sioux songs with this peculiarity\
    \ are noted in Bulletin 53, page 81, and Bulletin 61, page 343. It also begins\
    \ and ends on the same tone. (See Nos. 42, 59, 91, and 97 of this series; also\
    \ Bull. 53, p. 222, and Bull. 61, p. 257.) About one-third of the intervals are\
    \ fourths. Two rhythmic units occur, the rhythm of the second unit being steadily\
    \ different from that of the first unit. A first and second ending occurs also\
    \ in the dupli cation No. 39 and in No. 48. \r\nThis song is considered in the\
    \ Appendix, pages 206-208."

  description: "This song contains only the tones of the minor triad and seventh.\
    \ The only other Ute song containing this tone material is No. 71.\r\nConcerning\
    \ this characteristic among Chippewa songs, see Bulletin 45, page 142, and Bulletin\
    \ 53, page 258; among the Sioux songs, see Bulletin 61, pages 184,337. This chord\
    \ has been found in the music of the American Negro 18 and was noted by Prof.\
    \ J. C. Fillmore in songs of the Nass River Indians living in British Columbia;\
    \ also among the songs of the Dahomy collected by Prof. Fillmore at the World's\
    \ Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1892.\r\nIn the songs analyzed by the present\
    \ writer this chord appears in two forms: (1) In songs of minor tonality it constitutes\
    \ the tonic chord with seventh added, and (2) in songs of major tonality it constitutes\
    \ the submediant chord with the dominant of the key added as its highest tone.\
    \ It will be noted that in the first form the tonic triad appears as the lower\
    \ and in the second form as the upper portion of the chord. The second is the\
    \ more frequent form, as shown by the fact that 11 Chippewa songs are characterized\
    \ by this chord and only three are minor in tonality. (See song No. 30.) In the\
    \ song under analysis the tonic triad (G sharp, B-D sharp) forms the framework\
    \ of the melody, the seventh being less prominent and occurring only twice. The\
    \ rhythmic unit is short and its repe titions comprise all the song except the\
    \ closing measures. Four renditions were recorded and show no differences except\
    \ that in one rendition the opening phrase, before the repeated portion, was omitted.\
    \ Major and minor thirds constitute 68 per cent of the progressions."

  description: We have before us for consideration two renditions of a song by the
    same singer (cf. Nos. 77, 78), the first rendition being- recorded in 1914 and
    the second -in 1916. The duplication was accidental, which adds to the interest
    of the comparison. On the first occasion the song was sung three times and on
    the second it was sung twice. Comparing the transcriptions of the two rendi tions,
    we find in the second a more regular rhythm and also an ornamentation of the melody,
    as in the third measure. The first-named peculiarity is shown by the presence
    of rhythmic units, the latter by a larger proportion of whole-tone progressions.
    Inquiry was made concerning the life of the singer during the two years elapsing
    between the making of the records, as the rhythm might possibly be influenced
    by an adaptation to the ways of the white man. The Government officials on the
    reservation were, however, of the opinion that ho appreciable change had taken
    place in the singer and the difference in the records was attributed by them to
    a difference in mood at the time of recording.

  description: This song contains only one word (Tsiyuta), said to be the Shoshoni
    term applied by them to the Utes. The rhythmic struc ture of the song comprises
    four periods, each containing four meas ures, except the third, which has only
    three measures. Each of these periods ends with a triple measure. In melodic form
    the song is characterized by wide expansion and small intervals, the range being
    1 1 tones and about 60 per cent of the progressions being smaller than a major
    third. (See No. 2&.) Three renditions were recorded, the only differences being
    a slight variation in the fourth measure. The song contains all the tones of the
    octave.

  description: This song resembles No. 17, which was sung at the conclusion of the
    Bear dance, but a comparison of the trend of the two melodies shows the upper
    tone to be the more important in No. 17 and the lower tone in the present instance.
    A fundamental and its minor third are the only tones in this song, while No. 17
    contains also the minor seventh, occurring as an unaccented tone. This song comprises
    four periods, all having the same rhythm. It begins and ends on the same tone.

  description: This melody progresses chiefly by the minor third, which constitutes
    71 per cent of the intervals. The rhythmic unit comprises five measures and occurs
    twice. It interesting to note the resemblance between the opening measures of
    the song and the rhythmic unit. Nine renditions were recorded without a break
    in the time. The drumbeat was synchronous with the voice.

  description: In this song, which was sung at the conclusion of the Dragging-feet
    dance, there was a break in the drumbeat, as a signal for the end of the dancing.
    This break was always given at the same point in -the song. In two renditions
    this interruption occurred as transcribed (cf. No. 30). It is interesting to note
    that in the inter rupted portion the drumbeat is slightly after the voice, while
    in the remainder of the song it is synchronous with the voice. The only difference
    in the renditions (several of which were without drum) is that in a few instances
    the first tone in the second occurrence of the rhythmic unit was sung as a quarter
    note. The rhythmic unit is long, as in No. 43. With the exception of one interval,
    a minor sixth, the progressions are thirds and major seconds. The song is melodic
    in structure and contains the tones of the fourth five-toned scale.

  description: The keynote of this song is considered to be E, the tonality is therefore
    major, yet the major third appears only once as a progression. The interval of
    a fourth is strongly in evidence, both as a progression and in the structure of
    the melody. A rhythmic unit occurs four times in succession, the two first occurrences
    being on the tone F sharp, E, B, and the second and third occurrences being on
    the tones B, G sharp, F sharp, after which the melody descends to B along lines
    which suggest the tonic chord. The portion of the melody included in measures
    4 to 8 resembles numerous other Ute dances in its reiteration of a minor third
    (cf..Nos. 16, 42, 51). The tone material in this portion of the song is similar
    to that in No. 2. Other songs containing rests are noted in the analysis of No.
    8, and other songs with connective phrase in the analysis of No. 7.

  description: The drumbeat of this song is similar to that of the preceding song,
    during which the people danced. The song had the unusual range of 15 tones and
    is based on the fourth five-toned scale. Two renditions were recorded without
    variation. This is interesting, as three rhythmic units occur, the first and third
    closely resembling each other. The eighth measure contains a reversal of the count-
    divisions of the second rhythmic unit, in a triple measure. As has been noted,
    a measure of this sort frequently gives a certain balance to the rhythm of a song
    as a whole.

  description: This song contains only the tones of the major triad and second, has
    a compass of 11 tones, and is melodic in structure. The fourth occurs 14 times,
    comprising about half the entire number of intervals. In contrast to the preceding
    song the drumbeat is in unaccented eighth notes. For other songs containing rests
    see No. 8. A first and second ending occurs also in the duplication of No. 39
    and in No. 48.

  description: This song comprises three rhythmic periods, each with its rhythmic
    unit. The tone material is the major triad and sixth, which is less frequent in
    the Ute songs than in those of the Chippewa and Sioux. An ascending fourth occurs
    five times and a descending minor third occurs nine times. In contrast to the
    preceding song the drumbeat is in unaccented eighth notes.

  description: Two rhythmic units occur in this song, the second appearing to be an
    elaboration of the first. The opening and closing measures contain phrases which
    resemble but do not repeat the rhythmic unit. The principal interval is the minor
    third, which con stitutes more than 60 per cent of the progressions. All the tones
    of the octave occur in the song, which is harmonic in structure. Drum and voice
    are synchronous.

  description: This song is on the fourth five-toned scale with D flat as its keynote.
    In structure it is melodic with harmonic framework. The rhythmic unit comprises
    three measures. Attention is directed to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh measures,
    which bear a close resem blance to the rhythmic unit, but were sung with a different
    accent and phrasing. The half note in the ninth measure was sung as the close
    of the preceding phrase, the tenth measure was begun with an accent, and the eleventh
    measure given two quarter notes instead of one half note. This distinction was
    clearly given in all renditions of the song.

  description: This melody is simple in form, has a compass of an octave, and contains
    the tones of the fourth five-toned scale. It begins on the octave, and ends on
    the tonic, about two-thirds of the progressions being downward. In structure it
    is melodic. No rhythmic unit occurs and the song as a whole has not a decided
    rhythm. For other songs containing rests see No. 8.

  description: Several renditions of this song were recorded and show no material
    variation. This is interesting to note, as the two rhythmic units differ only
    in the division of the final count. The song is on the fourth five-toned scale
    and has a compass of an octave. The fourth is a prominent interval, comprising
    more than a fourth of the entire number of progressions. The association of this
    interval with songs concerning motion has been frequently noted. This song resembles
    the song next following so closely as to suggest an unintentional duplication.

  description: Between the renditions of this song there was sung a brief connective
    phrase which is represented in the transcription by two half notes, but which
    was sung with various divisions of the count. It is of interest as showing the
    manner in which the Utes frequently break the ascent of an octave in repeating
    a song. This is contrasted with the customs of the Sioux and Chippewa, who fre
    quently make the direct ascent of an octave or a twelfth in repeating a song.
    Songs having a connective phrase are noted in the analysis of No. 7. This song
    is divided rhythmically into two parts, which are alike except for the fifth measure.
    It will be readily noted that no measure corresponding to this appears after the
    rhythmic units in the second portion of the song. Another slight difference is
    that the first part ends in 3-A and the second in 2-4 time. The tempo of the drum
    was not strictly maintained, but was slightly slower than the voice throughout
    the renditions. --The melody is on the fourth five-toned scale, and about three-fourths
    of the intervals are descending progres sions.

  description: This song contains only the tones of the minor triad and seventh, a
    tone-material which is considered in the analysis of No. 38. Throughout the rendition
    of this song the tone was firm and the intonation good. The descent of a seventh
    in two intervals, occurring in the rhythmic unit, is effective and is barbaric
    in character. The intervals are large, and only 19 progressions occur in the song.
    The tempo is quite slow. The interval of a fifth is prominent in this song, 42
    per cent of the progressions being fifths.

  description: Instead of a uniform drumbeat throughout the song, we have in this
    instance a very rapid drumbeat in the opening meas ures, followed by a quarter-note
    rhythm. Other songs with the same peculiarity are Nos. 86, 87, and 88. This seems
    an individual phase rather than one connected with the character of the song.
    The quarter-note drumbeat was maintained steadily during the 3-8 measures of the
    song and synchronized occasionally with the voice. Only one other song (No. 22)
    begins in 3-8 time. In the fourth and fifth renditions the singer interpolated
    sharp, shrill cries before the connective phrase. (See No. 7.) The melody contains
    the tones of the fourth five-toned scale and is melodic in structure. Only one-
    fourth of the intervals are larger than a minor third.

    In both renditions the second count in the second measure was sung as two eighth
    notes, thus differentiating it from the rhythmic unit in which the corresponding
    count is sung as a quarter note. Neither are the divisions of the last count like
    those in the following measure. Only about one-eighth of the intervals are larger
    than a major third, and more than half are major and minor seconds. (See No. 28.)
    The song has a compass of an octave.

    Two renditions were recorded, each containing a repeated portion as indicated
    in the transcription. Two rhythmic units occur, the difference between them being
    slight but clearly given by the singer. The song is melodic in structure, and
    almost half the intervals are major seconds.

  description: This song is characterized by a compass of 12 tones, which is unusual
    in this series. The song contains no change of time, differing in this respect
    from a majority of the present songs. The rhythmic unit is interesting and occurs
    seven times. As cending and descending intervals are almost equal in number, the
    song containing 10 ascending and 10 descending major thirds. The melody contains
    only the tones of the major triad.

  description: A peculiarity of this song is the measure in slower time, this change
    in tempo being the same in all renditions. (See No. 11.) The phrasing was clearly
    given throughout the song. Sixty per cent of the intervals are minor thirds, about
    equally divided between ascending and descending progressions. The song contains
    only the tones of the major triad and sixth.

  description: "This song was recorded by the same singer at two differ ent times,\
    \ thus affording an interesting opportunity for observing the accuracy with which\
    \ the song was repeated. (Cf. Nos. 39 and 78.) Six renditions were recorded in\
    \ 1914, the renditions being uniform and connected without a break in the time.\
    \ The transcrip tion is from the cylinder made in 1914. Five renditions of the\
    \ same song were recorded in 1916, at which time the writer did not play, the\
    \ first record, but \"hummed\" the transcription. The singer recog nized it and\
    \ said he would like to make another record of it. This second cylinder was transcribed\
    \ and the results compared. In this comparison it is found that all the renditions\
    \ recorded in 1916 omit the fifth and sixth measures and the last measure of the\
    \ song as transcribed. As these measures are repetitions, this would be of slight\
    \ importance, but as it reduces the occurrences of these phrases from three to\
    \ two the change suggests a tendency toward regularity and conventionality. The\
    \ first group of renditions was in a tempo of quarter = 104, and the key of G\
    \ minor: the second was faster (quarter =108) but in a lower key\u2014the key\
    \ of F sharp minor. The 5-4 division of certain measures was strictly maintained.\
    \ The song contains the tones of the second five-toned scale and is melodic in\
    \ structure. Considering the lack of variety in progressions the melody is inter\
    \ esting and quite diversified. One-half the intervals are minor thirds, and of\
    \ the other half all except one interval are major seconds, that interval being\
    \ an ascending fourth. Other songs containing rests are noted in the analysis\
    \ of No. 8."

  description: "This song was twice recorded by the same singer, only one of the records\
    \ being transcribed (cf. Nos. 39 and 77). The repetition arose from an impression\
    \ frequently noted among the Indians, that if the words are changed in a melody\
    \ it becomes a different song. Thus, in the first instance, the singer said this\
    \ was a song which he sang in the war dance when he brought home a captive woman,\
    \ and, in the second instance, he said it was a scalp dance song. The words were\
    \ not taken in either rendition.\r\nA comparison of the two cylinders shows the\
    \ pitch of the rendi tions to be the same. Five repetitions of the song were recorded\
    \ the first time and six the second time. The differences in these 11 renditions\
    \ are too slight to be of importance. In the first group the opening phrase was\
    \ occasionally repeated, and in the second group the ending was occasionally changed\
    \ in rhythm, and the fifth measure (last two counts) contained quarter in place\
    \ of eighth notes. Passing from this comparison to an analysis of the transcription,\
    \ we note that the melody contains only the tones of the minor triad and fourth\
    \ and in structure is melodic with harmonic framework. More than half the intervate\
    \ are minor thirds, a majority of the remainder being major seconds."

  description: Considering F to be the keynote of this song, we find the tone material
    to comprise the keynote, third, and fourth. The structure of the song shows, however,
    what has been termed an "interval-formation" rather than a key-relation of the
    several tones. (See Bull. 53, pp. 7, 8.) Thus the first portion, and in every
    instance the rhythmic unit, is on the fifth (B flat-F), while the middle and closing
    measures are on the minor third (F-A flat). The intervals are larger than in a
    majority of these songs, about one-fourth of them being fifths. The. major second
    comprises only about one- sixth of the total number. Drum and voice have the same
    tune unit, but because of slight variations in tempo they seldom coincide for
    more than a few measures.

  description: The measure-divisions in this song were clearly given in all the renditions,
    and as the tempo is so rapid it is considered advisable that the time unit be
    indicated as an eighth note. The rhythmic unit occurs twice and is peculiar in
    character. The fourth is a prominent interval, comprising more than one-fourth
    of the pro gressions. The minor third appears with about the same frequency. In
    structure the song is melodic with harmonic framework, and the melody tones are
    those of the major triad and sixth.

  description: This song, like many others of the present series, pro gresses chiefly
    by whole tones (see No. 28), yet it is a melody with abundant variety and interest.
    In structure it is melodic and con tains the tones of the major triad and second.
    The drum is slightly faster than the voice and its tempo was steadily maintained.
    A rhythmic unit occurs six times in the song.

  description: The slow tempo of this song was steadily maintained throughout three
    renditions, which were sung without a break in the time. The melody progresses
    chiefly by whole tones, which con stitute two-thirds of the intervals. The song
    is melodic in structure and contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh.

  description: The rendering of this song was particularly clear in intonation and
    count divisions, not varying in the repetitions. Drum and voice have the same
    time unit and are synchronous. The song is peculiar in that the only progressions
    are fifths, fourths, and semi tones, and also in that the ascending and descending
    progressions are almost equal in number. The melody tones are those of the major
    triad and second, and the structure of the song is melodic with harmonic framework.
    (Concerning the connective phrase see No. 7.)

  description: Five renditions of this song were recorded, two being separated by
    shrill cries and the others connected by a short phrase. (See No. 7.) In every
    rendition the accent is changed in the last occurrence of the rhythmic unit. Minor
    thirds and major seconds are the principal intervals of progression, though the
    variety of intervals is greater than in a majority of the Ute songs under analysis.

  description: This melody contains six kinds of intervals in ascending progression,
    which is an unusual number. The drumbeat in the first four measures of the first
    rendition was tremolo, after which the quarter-note beat was continuous. (See
    No. 72.) Drum and voice have the same time unit, determined by the majority of
    the meas ures, but the drum is steadily maintained, while the voice tempo varies
    slightly. The time of the transcription should be understood as indicating the
    accents and the approximate note values rather than actual durations, of time,
    resembling some of the songs in which the pitch indicated by -the notation is
    only approximate. These variabilities are too slight to be shown in any except
    an exceedingly detailed graphic form, the transcription showing, however, the
    trend of the melody with sufficient exactness for our present purpose. Four renditions
    were recorded and contain no important differences. The connective phrase in this
    song is unusually long. Another song using a similar phrase between renditions
    is No. 7.

  description: Drum and voice have the same time unit in this song, but because of
    slight variations in tempo they never exactly coincide. In each rendition the
    drumbeat was tremolo to the point marked X, after which it was in quarter notes.
    (See No. 72.) Three rhythmic units occur, the first being emphatic in character
    and appearing always on the same tones, which is unusual. The third unit differs
    from the second only in the division of the last count, but this dif ference was
    steadily maintained. The tone material is that of the fourth five-toned scale
    and the song has a compass of 1 2 tones. The average interval in this song comprises
    four semitones. Reference to the tables of analysis on page 42 will show this
    to be an unusually large interval.

  description: This song has a compass of 12 tones and contains the major triad and
    second. In structure it is melodic with harmonic framework. The drumbeat was tremolo
    to the point marked X, after which in four renditions it was in quarter-note values.
    (See No. 72.) The repetitions of the song necessitate an ascending interval of
    a twelfth, which was sung with good intonation. The fourth is the interval of
    most frequent occurrence, constituting 54 per cent of the entire number of intervals.
    (See No. 3.) This interval has frequently been noted as associated with the idea
    of motion.

    contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh.

  description: Few songs of the present series are so typical as this, yet the quality
    which makes it typical is hard to define. Two-thirds of the intervals are minor
    thirds and major seconds, but in this it resembles many other songs. Neither is
    the proportion of ascending and descending intervals unusual, there being 40 per
    cent of ascending and 60 per cent of descending progressions. But the song is
    minor in tonality with a special prominence of the subdominant. This is quite
    unusual and worthy of consideration by students. The melody tones are those of
    the second five-toned scale with the seventh sharped. The tonic chord appears
    as the framework of the melody. The ascent of an octave in the first measure and
    the beginning and ending on the same tone are noted in the analysis of No. 37.
    A short con nective phrase was sung between the renditions. (See No. 7.)

  description: Throughout the renditions of this song the intonation on the descending
    minor third was faulty, yet the fourth and octave were sung with good intonation.
    The fourth constitutes about one- third of the progressions. The song is harmonic
    in structure and contains the tones of the major triad and fourth. (Concerning
    the use of a connective phrase see No. 7.)

  description: The rhythmic structure of this song is worthy of special attention.
    The first two measures were sung only once, after which the remainder of the song
    as transcribed was sung four times, the last rendition ending at the double bar.
    An introductory phrase is rarely used in Ute songs, though appearing frequently
    in the songs of the Chippewa. Other songs of this series containing a connective
    phrase are noted in the analysis of No. 7. In all the renditions of this song
    the count divisions were as indicated. The song comprises two rhythmic periods
    which resemble each other yet show enough difference to give variety and character
    to the song as a whole. The first period comprises the third, fourth, and fifth
    measures, and the second comprises the three following measures. A comparison
    of these will show the variations. The song has a compass of 1 1 tones and contains
    the major triad and second. The whole tone is the chief interval of progression
    (see No! 24). Although the song is major in tonality, the major third does not
    appear as a progression.

  description: This song characterized by sliding upward of tone and by short rests.
    (See No. 8.) The rhythmic unit interesting and occurs twice. Five renditions were
    given with no break in the time, the final measure always containing three counts,
    as transcribed. The song harmonic in structure and the intervals are more varied
    than in majority of these songs. The melody tones are those of the major triad

  description: Five renditions of this peculiar melody were recorded, the only differences
    being that in one rendition a certain phrase was repeated. As indicated, there
    was no break in the time between the renditions. The rhythmic unit gives coherence
    to the melody, and it is possible to show this in notation, though the peculiar
    manner of singing can not be graphically shown. The song contains 16 pro gressions,
    13 of which are fourths. (See No. 3.) It has a compass of six tones and contains
    the tones of the major triad and second. For other songs containing rests see
    No. 8.

  description: The time was not rigidly maintained in the renditions of this song,
    but the drum was persistently a little faster than the voice. The renditions differ
    very slightly, in some the second count of the first measure being omitted. It
    will be noted that this omis sion makes the two parts of the song alike. The progressions
    are 30 in number, 26 being minor thirds and 4 major thirds, yet G is the implied
    keynote of the melody. The song begins and ends on the same tone, which is unusual.
    (See No. 37.) Other songs containing rests are noted in the analysis of No. 8.

  description: The part of this song preceding the change of time was sung only once,
    followed by the second part, which was sung nine times without a break in the
    time. The first part is a pleasing melody with little character. The second part
    is unmistakably a hand game song, resembling No. 98. As the singer was considered
    a reliable informant, the song is presented as it was sung. It has a compass of
    nine tones and contains the tones of the fourth five-toned scale; 58 progressions
    occur, 40 of which are major seconds (whole tones). (Concerning the change of
    tempo see No. 11.)

  description: Six renditions of this song were recorded and show no differences except
    that the second count of the third measure was occasionally sung as two eighth
    notes. The song presents some interesting points of rhythm. Thus we note that
    the last count of the second measure contains a reversal of the count divisions
    in the second count of the rhythmic unit. The fifth measure contains in its second
    count a division resembling that of the rhythmic unit but which was uniformly
    sung as two sixteenths instead of an eighth note. The only progressions are fourths
    and major seconds. In ascending progression there are seven fourths and three
    whole tones, and in descending progression there are eight fourths and three whole
    tones. Considering A to be the keynote of the melody, its tones are the key note,
    fourth, and fifth. Four drumbeats were equivalent in time to one quarter note
    of the melody; the drum is therefore regarded as having a rhythm of sixteenth
    notes. Drum and voice were synchro nous at the beginning of each count.

  description: In all the four renditions of this song the division of the first count
    in the first measure was different from that of the corresponding count in the
    third measure. These slight differences repeated persistently show that the rhythm
    of the song is clear hi the mind of the singer. This song is harmonic in structure
    and has a compass of five tones. The major third constitutes 76 per cent of the
    progressions, the remaining intervals being four minor thirds and one ascending
    fifth.

  description: This song opens with the same phrase which formed the rhythmic unit
    of the preceding song, but as there is no phrase resembling it in the remainder
    of the song it is not considered a rhythmic unit. The compass of the song is only
    six tones, this being much smaller than that of the preceding songs. The melody
    tones are those of the fourth five-toned scale. A rapid drumbeat charac terizes
    the song, only one other song of this series (No. 100) having the same drum rhythm.

    contains the major triad and second. The principal interval is the major second,
    comprising 71 per cent of the intervals. (See No. 24.) The song contains no rhythmic
    unit and is not rhythmic in general character.

  description: This song is characterized by the interval of the fourth, one-third
    of the intervals being fourths. The song has no rhythmic interest, which may account
    for the fact that the renditions differ in tone values, the transcription being
    from the first rendition. In structure the song is melodic, in tonality it is
    major, and it contains all the tones of the octave except the sixth and seventh.
    It has a compass of seven tones.

    five-toned scale. It progresses chiefly by whole tones, about 61 per cent of the
    intervals being major seconds. (See No. 24.) The fourth is also a prominent interval.

  description: In this song the fourth is raised a semitone. The song contains all
    the tones of the octave except the seventh and is har monic in structure. The
    progressions number 44, somewhat more than the usual number in Ute songs. Only
    four of these intervals are larger than a minor third.
