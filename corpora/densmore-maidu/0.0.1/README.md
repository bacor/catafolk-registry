Notes on additional metadata
----------------------------

Additional metadata was collected from the original publication (Densmore 1958) by Bas Cornelissen in 2020. It is stored as a separate [CSV file](https://github.com/bacor/catafolk/blob/master/datasets/densmore-maidu/additional-metadata.csv), see also this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_rglgtSAbLfBCS9HeOUkKBpr7I0w7ZrUITETJXWjcoc/edit?usp=sharing)

- I'm not entirely sure about the language of the songs, and opted for the
larger family [Maiduan](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/maid1262).
- It's not always clear where percussion is used. Whenever it was clear that 
an accompaniament was used, this is indicated, but missing values do not mean 
there was no accompaniament.
