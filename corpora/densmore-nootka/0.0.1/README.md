Catafolk notes
--------------

- Song 49 appears twice in the dataset, with two different drum parts. 
    Only the first version is included, so `No_49_Wand_Dance_Song_-_with_2nd_rendition_drums.krn` is
    ignored.
- All songs have the same location (Neah Bay, Washington), since 
Densmore reports that she collected all songs there (p. V).


Notes on additional metadata
----------------------------

[Google Docs sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzxubs3CQsWIwBBVZgmlWY7vN9xISJ1W5GNxYKsed_U)

- If there was no indication of the use of a drum (e.g. a drum tempo, or a drum trancription),
    the song is assumed to be monophonic.
- Meters were transcribed (mostly) in order of occurance (but every meter is included only once)
- Tempo transcriptions generally follow the tempo indication for the voice (sometimes a drum tempo is also indicated)
