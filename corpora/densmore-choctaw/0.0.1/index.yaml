  description: This melody is based on intervals, not on the relationship of tones
    to a keynote. The principal interval is a whole tone, occurring chiefly between
    A flat and B flat, next in frequency being the minor third between B flat and
    D flat. The keynote is regarded as D flat, which occurs as next to the highest
    tone, and the melody contains only this tone with its second and fifth.

  description: This interesting melody is based on the minor triad and minor seventh,
    with the tones occurring in descending order. Slight differences in the repetitions
    are shown, these occurring in the middle of the song, where changes most frequently
    occur in the melodic or rhythmic pattern of an Indian song. The ti'anscription
    is a semitone lower than the pitch of the rendition. As in similar instances,
    a. simpler signature is used when the pitch of the rendition would require six
    sharps or flats.

  description: As in No. 2, the keynote occurs only as the highest tone in this melody.
    The peculiar measure lengths were accurately repeated in all the renditions, also
    the length of the rests. This transcription contains a plus sign over several
    notes, showing the tone was slightly above the indicated pitch. This occurs also
    in Nos. 5, 22, 23, 25, 28, 36, and 38, and is used only when the deviation from
    pitch is persistent in all the renditions.

  description: In contrast to the preceding war songs, the keynote of this melody
    is the lowest tone and is strongly emphasized. This gives an effect of iwsitive-
    ness that has been noted in songs of success in other tribes. A change to minor
    tonality is indicated by an accidental rather than by a change of signature.

  description: The chief interest of this song is in the thematic treatment of the
    opening phrase. This is evident throughout the melody and is the more interesting
    as Wesley is not accustomed to singing these old songs at the present time.

  description: The rhythm of this melody is strongly marked, this quality of the melody
    taking the place of an instrumental accompaniment. The interest of the rhythm
    centers in the slight variations of the rhythmic unit which produce a swaying
    effect. The first and second occurrences of the unit begin with a descending progression
    and the third and fourth occurrences begin with an ascending progression, which
    produces an effect of swaying. The song has a compass of five tones and contains
    only the tones of the minor triad and fourth.

  description: This song is the first example of the period formation described on
    page 118. The second period is distinguished by changes of tempo and phrases containing
    small count-divisions. Two descending, over-lapping fourths occur frequently,
    these being C-G and A-E, but the principal interval in the framework of the melody
    is the minor third between E and G. A minor third comprises 38 of the 65 intervals.

    \ phrases in period A are long and contain two rhythmic units. Period B contains\
    \ frequent short rests and no rhythmic unit. A wwhole tone is the most frequent\
    \ interval of progression. The pitch was gradually raised a semitone during the\
    \ singing of this song, a mannerism occuring in no other performance by the Choctaw.\
    \ It occurs frequently in Pueblo songs and is given extended consideration in\

  description: The emphatic rhythm of this song, together with the rise and fall of
    the melody, takes the place of an instrumental accompaniament. The song contains
    no change of measure length, thus maintaining a steady rhythm. Three rhythmic
    units occur. These second and third units differ only in one tone, but this difference
    was given with distinctness. the melody lies partly above and partly below the
    keynote, and contains only the tones of the minor triad and fourth.

  description: This melody is based on intervals, not on the relationship of tones
    to a keynote. As in similar songs, the signature is used for convenience in showing
    the pitch of the tones, not as an indication of key in the musician's use of that
    term. Three descending fourths form the framework of the melody. In the order
    of occurrence there are A flat-E flat, B flat-F, and E flat-B flat.

  description: The keynote and fifth are the most prominent tones in this melody.
    The tone transcribed as G sharp was clearly sung, also the augmented second whichfollows.
    Gus Willis joined with Tubby in this song to show the manner in which other singers
    join the leader. His voice entered on the fourth measure and continued in unison
    with Tubby's. Other songs in which Willis joined are Nos. 18, 19, 25, 26, 33,
    and 35. This "second part" is not indicated in the transcriptions (cf. p. 121).

  description: This melody as recorded by Olman Comby is more melodious and less rhythmic
    than the six preceding versions of the Tick dance song sung by Lysander Tubby.
    Comby is an Indian policeman at the agency and expressed familiarity with the
    Choctaw custroms in other localities. The tonality of this song is major but the
    minor third below the keynote is a prominent interval. The descent to this tone
    produces a minor triad with minor seventh, the tones being indescending order.
    In structure the song may be said to consist of two overlapping triads, the upper
    being major and the lower being minor. The song has a compass of an octave and
    lies partly above and partly below the keynote.

  description: "The Drunken-man dance songs (Nos. 21\u201328) are simple and do not\
    \ require detailed analysis. A majority of the melodies are based on a major or\
    \ minor triad and the count divisions consist chiefly of quarter and eighth notes.\
    \ A nota legato occurs in Nos. 23 and 26, and a swaying effect is given by the\
    \ melody and rhythm of No. 26, a melody lying partly above and partly below the\
    \ keynote. The melodic material of No. 26 consists of a tone (regarded as the\
    \ keynote) with a minor third above and a whole tone below that tone. In No. 27\
    \ the only tones are a keynote with its minor third and fourth. The keynote in\
    \ No. 28 is F, but the third above that tone does not occur. This song contains\
    \ a more varied rhythm than other songs of this dance."

  description: The principal interval in this song is the major third from G to B,
    followed by a descent to D in some measures and to E in others. Thus the tonality
    seems to waver between major and minor. With a single exception the rhythmic unit
    occurs on one series of tones, suggesting the repetition of a single motion in
    the dance. The opening phrase is energetic, the rhythmic unit is brisk, and the
    whole song is lively and interesting.

  description: Repetitions of the rhythmic unit constitute this entire melody, with
    the progressions alike on the second and alternate phrases. These suggest a major
    triad, while the first phrase and alternate phrases are based on a minor triad.
    The tone material is that of the fourth 5-toned scale, and about two-thirds of
    the intervals are whole tones. The striking sticks are in the same meter as the
    voice, but each stroke slightly preceded the voice, as though hastening it.

  description: These two songs (Nos, 31, 32), recorded by different singers, are practically
    the same in the first portion but differ in the second portion which was repeated
    an indefinite number of times in the dancing. The first song is the more interesting
    and contains a change of tempo. The second song maintains the original tempo and
    was sung by the customary leader of the dance. The original tempo and pitch are
    about the same in the two songs. As in many other Choctaw songs, the framework
    is that of a triad with the third as the highest tone.

  description: "The first song of this group (Nos. 34\u201338) begins with a minor\
    \ third and is clearly minor in tonality, but the others begin with a major third,\
    \ followed by a descent of a minor third completing a minor triad. Nos. 35, 36\
    \ and 37 were recorded on the same day, with several renditions of each, and no.\
    \ 38 was recorded a few days later. On comparing the transcriptions, we note such\
    \ a resemblance in general form that they might, possibly, be regarded as variants\
    \ of a single melody. The singer, however, was a man of unusual ability and experience\
    \ and the Steal-partner dance is a popular dance, employing many songs. Under\
    \ these circumstances it is possible that close resemblances might occur in the\
    \ melodies, which he recorded without hesitation. The most elaborate of these\
    \ songs is No. 38, which contains three rhythmic units, numerous measures in 5-8\
    \ time and several occurences of nota legato. In Nos. 33 and 35 Gus Willis joined\
    \ the singer after the first phrase, the voices continuing in unisono (cf. p.\
    \ 121)."

  description: The two parts of this song were separated by a pause In the recording.
    The first part is based ont he fourth 5-toned scale and if the second part were
    a tone higher, it would correspond to the upper portion of that series. It is
    transcribed as sung, and we note that the second part is on a minor third, suggesting
    the change from major to minor tonality that was noted in earlier songs of this
    dance. The rhythmic units in the two parts are the same length but differ in count
    divisions.

  description: An interesting change of rhythm occurs in this melody. The divisions
    of the five counts beginning with the last count in the third measure are the
    same as in the two preceding measures, but a change of accent produces a different
    rhythm. A whole tone comprises one-half the progressions, next in frequency being
    a minor third. This melody contains the period formation, but the form is not
    so clear as in the song next following.

  description: A minor triad forms the framework of period A in this melody. Period
    B opens with an ascent to the seventh, the melody then descending on the tones
    of a minor triad and minor seventh, a sequence of tones characterizing primitive
    music.  Period B is in double time in its first occurence and in triple time in
    its second occurence. The melody tones are those of the second 5-toned scale.

  description: The short rhythmic unit in the first of these songs is extended in
    the second. A major triad forms the framework of the first song and the middle
    phrase of the second, followed by a distinct change of rhythm and a descent to
    E, introducing a minor triad and minor seventh with the tones in descending order.
    The "shouts" with the two songs were different, those which preceded and followed
    the first song being shown as nearly as possible in the transcription. The second
    song is in the same tempo as the first. The "shouts" were different and are not
    indicated. The melody tones of both songs are those of the fourth 5-toned scale
    and the number of progressions is the same in both songs, comprising 12 descending
    and 9 ascending intervals. Variety is given to the rhythm of the striking sticks
    by a change to 2 eighth-note beats on the last coimt of each triple measure.

  description: A period formation characterizes this song, the second period being
    short and higher in pitch than the remainder of the melody. The most prominent
    interval is the whole tone between F sharp and G sharp. Except for one ascending
    fourth, the intervals consist of whole tones and minor thirds

  description: In period formation this resembles the song next preceding. The highest
    tone occurs in the second period, as in a majority of songs with this form. In
    approaching this high tone, the singer overreached the interval and sang D sharp
    instead of D. The next note was B, after which he gradually lowered the pitch
    level until the final tone of the measure was A, as transcribed. This change in
    pitch level was clearly unintentional and is not shown in the transcription. The
    second period resembles the third rhythmic unit, but the change in the rhythm
    of the first count gives emphasis to the phrase.

  description: The keynote is the highest tone in this song and does not occur in
    the lower octave. This song is major in tonality, but about one-fourth of the
    intervals are minor thirds. The intervals of a major third and major sixth do
    not occur, and the fourth is a prominent interval. Ascending and descending progressions
    are about equal in number. The third measure is an interesting phrase and occurs
    at the close of each rhythmic unit.

    melody and produces a swaying effect. Attention is directed to the sixth and seventh
    measures which resemble the second rhythmic unit but are in double instead of
    triple time. The length of the periods is similar to that in the two preceding

  description: Three rhythmic units occur in this song, the second measure being the
    same in all. There is no change of measure lengths, which is unusual in Indian
    songs. The tones are those of the fourth 5-toned scale and the melody is framed
    chiefly on the descending fourths O-G, and B flat-F, the former being a broken
    and the latter a direct progression. The descending intervals are more than double
    the ascending intervals in number.

  description: Two renditions of this song were recorded and both are presented, the
    second followed by the first after a short pause. Slight differences occur and
    will be readily noted. The tones, the tempo, and the pitch of the two are the
    same, also the use of two rhythmic units. The first rendition contains an introductory
    phrase which is indicated as a rhythmic unit. This does not occur in the repetition
    of the song.

  description: This melody consists of four repetitions of the rhythmic unit. In three
    of its occurrences it is preceded by an unaccented tone and in the first by an
    accented half note. The tone material is that of the fourth 5-toned scale and
    about half the progressions are whole tones. An increase in tempo, customary in
    the dance, is shown in the transcription.

  description: The principal interval in this song is a major third (A-C sharp), which
    is followed in the second measure by a descent to F sharp, forming a minor triad,
    and in the fourth measure by a descent to E, completing a major triad. This form
    continues throughout the song and has been noted in numerous other Choctaw songs.
    Two rhythmic units occur, and the melody progresses by 18 ascending and 19 descending
    intervals. The tempo increased from quarter=76 to quarter =92 in the repetitions
    of the song.

  description: This melody is an interesting example of period formation, the second
    period being short, higher in pitch than the first and different in rhythm. A
    recurrence of the first period closes the song. Two rhythmic units occur, neither
    being in the second period. The first unit is based on a minor third and the second
    on the interval of a fourth, these units occurring chiefly in descending progression.
    Fourths and whole tones are equal in number, which is unusual in Indian songs.
    A swaying motion, with ascending and descending intervals in rapid succession,
    characterizes this and has been noted in other Choctaw dance songs.

  description: This was the first song recorded by Sidney Wesley. After he had recorded
    a second song, he expressed dissatisfaction with his first performance, saying
    he had not recorded the entire song and asking that another record be made. This
    was done, and the transcription is from his second recording of the song. On comparing
    the two performances, it was found that the first did not contain the third period.
    This, together with the intricate rhythm of the song, is an evidence of musical
    ability on the part of the singer. An entire change of rhythm occurs in the second
    period which is made emphatic by an accent on a sixteenth note. Four rhythmic
    units are shown in the transcription. The fourth unit begins with an unaccented
    tone, the next measure comprising the latter portion of the third rhythmic unit.
    About half the intervals are whole tones, and the fourths and major thirds are
    equal in number.

  description: The opening phrases of this song contain two descending fourths followed
    by two ascending fourths. In the fourth and fifth measures are found three consecutive
    ascending fourths with a slight prolonging of the highest tone. The tempo of the
    striking sticks was not maintained steadily, sometimes being slightly faster than
    the tempo of the voice.

  description: The entire performauce of this song was transcribed and occupied 2
    minutes. In tonality tlie song is minor, the tones being those of the second 5-toned
    scale. A slight change in tempo occurred, the change being gradual, and the original
    tempo resumed after a few measures. This change took place in each rendition.
    Phrases in the latter portion of the song were sometimes sung in a slightly faster
    tempo, but the change was not clear enough to be indicated in the transcription.
    Probably these changes in tempo were con- nected with the words of the song.

  description: This melody is short and its repetitions are transcribed because of
    the interest in the words. The structure is clear and comprises five phrases with
    practically the same rhythm. There is a peculiar quality in the rhythm that would
    make possible the continuance of the song for a long time. The tones are those
    of the fourth 5-toned scale, the entire melody lying above the keynote.

  description: The structure of this melody is freely melodic. The song is based on
    consecutive descending fourths, tliese being C-G and B flat-F. A minor third occurs
    in the fourth measure and a minor triad in the measure before the spoken words.
    These progressions suggest G as the keynote of the song. A slow rhythmic unit
    and a steady rhythm characterize the song which contains no suggestion of a chase.
    Instead it seems to reflect the mood of an observer, as indicated by the words.
    The song contains 10 ascending and 9 descending intervals
