issues:
  - title: Missing page numbers
    description: >
      There are no page numbers in the source files. We do have 
      song numbers, which can be derived from the catalogue numbers.
  - title: Cannot find scans
    description: >
      I can't find any scans of the book to verify the song 
      numbering...
  - title: Ignoring useful comments
    description: >
      We now ignore useful comments besides the metadata. For 
      example, in `deut3790`, we find the comment "Neuere Melodie, 
      noch 1850 am Niederrhein gehoert."
  - title: Genres correct?
    description: >
      Are the genrese correct? Them seem to be pretty much the 
      same most the time...?
